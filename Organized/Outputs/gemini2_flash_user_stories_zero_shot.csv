before i paired Honorband 4 to my device i had installed this app & whats strange is started counting my steps ...How its possible ?.. although its not showing correct data,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's the conversion of the user review into a user story:

**As a user, I'm confused and concerned because the app started counting my steps *before* I paired my Honorband 4, even though the data isn't accurate.**

**Explanation:**

*   **""As a user""**: Establishes the user perspective.
*   **""I'm confused and concerned""**: Captures the sentiment of the review (""what's strange"").
*   **""because the app started counting my steps *before* I paired my Honorband 4""**: Specifies the core issue - the app's unexpected behavior.
*   **""even though the data isn't accurate""**: Adds the context of the inaccurate data mentioned in the review.

This user story highlights the problem and implies that the user expects the app to accurately and appropriately record step data only after the device is connected. It raises concerns about data privacy and app functionality.

"Like the app. Except for everytime I put a workout in the app, my step cals always disappear, and the app doesn't show all my step cal.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user story options based on that review, listed from more general to very specific:

**Option 1: General and focuses on the problem**

*   **As a user, I want my step calorie data to accurately reflect my activity logging so I can reliably track my progress in the app.**

**Option 2: More specific, highlighting both issues**

*   **As a user, I want the app to consistently display all my step calories, even after I log a workout, so that I have a complete view of my daily activity and calorie expenditure.**

**Option 3: Very specific and detailed**

*   **As a user, I want my step calorie data to remain visible and complete after I log a workout in the app, instead of partially or completely disappearing, so that I can accurately track my overall calorie burn and workout effectiveness.**

**Why these options are good:**

*   **Focus on the user:** Each story starts with ""As a user"".
*   **State the need:** Each story clearly explains what the user needs (accurate step calorie data, consistent display).
*   **Explain the benefit:** Each story outlines why the user needs this (track progress, complete view, accurate tracking).
*   **Address the underlying problem:** These stories pinpoint the specific issue the user is facing with the app.

**Choosing the right option:**

The best option depends on the level of detail needed by the development team. A more general story might be a good starting point, while a more specific story provides more direct guidance for fixing the issue.

"It's great now. Love. Just wish you could pause the run instead of stopping it, or is there a way to pause without stopping it?",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Okay, here are a couple of user stories based on that review, prioritizing slightly different aspects:

**Focusing on the Functionality Request:**

*   **As a runner, I want to be able to pause my run tracking so that I can temporarily stop without ending my run.**

**Focusing on the Question of Current Functionality:**

**Combined Approach (Best):**

*   **As a runner, I want to be able to pause my run tracking (instead of stopping it), and I want to easily understand how to do it (if the feature already exists) so that I can temporarily stop without losing my data.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a runner""**:  Identifies the user type, grounding the story in the user's context.
*   **""I want to be able to""**: Uses the standard user story format.
*   **""...pause my run tracking instead of stopping it""**:  Clearly articulates the need for the pause functionality.

"Outdated app. Does not sync with Huawei Watch GT2 Pro (""not compatible""). Beware! Huawei asks to download an out-of-store .apk to use your smartwatch. Great hardwar but troublesome software. Find version from 2020, it will work.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story converted from the review, focusing on the user's goals and frustrations:

**As a user of a Huawei Watch GT2 Pro, I want to be able to seamlessly sync my watch with the app, so that I can utilize all the features of my smartwatch without having to resort to outdated or unsupported software.**

This impacts their ability to fully utilize their smartwatch and creates a poor user experience. The crafted user story precisely captures the frustration and provides an easy-to-understand goal for the development team to tackle.

"update: congrats, you did it. it's the first app i actually turned notifications off!!! original: why do you need 'read call logs' permission? and why app is so persistent about that?",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories extracted from that review, ranked by importance based on my interpretation:

**1. As a user, I want to understand why the app needs permission to read my call logs, so I can feel confident about the app's privacy and security.**

  *   **Priority:** High - Addresses the core concern and potential barrier to using the app.

**2. As a user, I appreciate the app having notifications that are useful and not excessive, so that I don't feel the need to turn them off completely.**

  *   **Priority:** Medium - Implies the original app had irritating notification behavior that has been resolved. Positive change.

**3. As a user, I want the app to be less persistent about requesting permissions, so that I don't feel harassed or distrustful.**

  *   **Priority:** Medium - Related to the call log permission but more about the overall experience.

**Explanation of choices:**

*   The reason for including both 1 and 3 (even though they are related) is that they highlight different aspects of the problem. 1 focuses on the *why*, while 3 focuses on the *how* the app is requesting the permission.

*   I interpreted the ""congrats you did it"" as a positive sign indicating a previous problem was fixed.

These user stories give the development team concrete goals to address the user's feedback effectively.

Worse than previous version. Walking distance is not correct. 20 min normally gives me 2 miles in older versions and other app. This gave o.67 mil,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user story options written from the user's perspective, based on the review:

**Option 1 (Focus on Accuracy):**

*   **As a user, I want the walking distance displayed by the app to be accurate and consistent with previous versions and other apps, so I can reliably track my progress and understand how far I've walked.**
    *   Acceptance Criteria:
        *   The walking distance displayed should be within +/- 5% of what I expect based on previous versions of the app and other popular fitness tracking apps.
        *   When I walk for 20 minutes at a normal pace, the app should report a distance close to 2 miles.

**Option 2 (Focus on Regression/Comparison):**

*   **As a user who has used previous versions of the app, I want the walking distance calculations to be as accurate as they were in older versions, so I don't feel like the new version is a downgrade and I can continue to rely on the app for accurate distance tracking.**
    *   Acceptance Criteria:
        *   The app's walking distance calculation should be no less accurate than in [Specify Version - e.g., Version 1.0].
        *   Walking a known distance (e.g., using a pedometer or measuring on a map) should yield similar results in the new version as in the older version.

**Option 3 (Focus on Fixing the Specific Problem):**

*   **As a user, I want the walking distance algorithm in the app to be fixed, so the app accurately measures distance for my walks and I can trust the data it provides.**
    *   Acceptance Criteria:
        *   When I walk for 20 minutes at a normal pace, the app shows show a distance between 1.8 miles and 2.2 miles.

**Key Considerations When Choosing:**

*   **Specificity:** How specific do you want to be in the story? The first option is more detailed and includes a measurable criterion.
*   **Underlying Cause:** Do you know the underlying reason for the inaccuracy? If so, framing the story to reflect that might be helpful. If not, focus on the ""what"" and the ""why"" rather than assuming you know the ""how.""
*   **Team Knowledge:** How much does the development team already know about this issue? If they understand it well, a simple story might suffice. If it's a new problem, more detail is better.

I recommend choosing the option that best aligns with your development process and the level of detail your team needs at this stage.

*   **easily reset my password** when I've forgotten it.

**So that I can:**

*   **access my account without needing to remember an old password** that I can no longer recall.
*   **avoid frustration and wasted time** when trying to use the app.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Additional Context (Implied from the Review):**

*   The user is frustrated with the current password reset process because it's not working as expected.
*   The user perceives the app's design as being more focused on the developer's preferences than the user's needs.
*   The user is likely feeling angry and believes the app is poorly designed in a way that negatively impacts them.

**Explanation of the changes:**

*   **Focus on User Need:** The user story focuses on what the user *wants* to achieve, rather than just complaining about the current situation.
*   **Clear Goal:** The ""So that I can"" section explains *why* the user wants the feature.
*   **Specific Criteria:** The ""Acceptance Criteria"" define what needs to be done to satisfy the user's request.
*   **User-centric Language:** The story is written from the perspective of the user (using ""I"").

"Was working great before the April 2015 update.   Hate the April 2015 update.  Don't like the colors.

Wife stopped using it, I'm looking for a replacement app.",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here's the user story based on the provided review:

**As a user who previously enjoyed using the app, I want a way to easily adjust serving sizes (as I could before the April 2015 update), to see color schemes I find appealing, and to be free from unnecessary branding like the Nike swoosh tile, so that I can return to using the app and my wife isn't driven away, ultimately preventing me from having to find a replacement.**

It just stopped working one fine day and asking for another Mobile services app to be downloaded and create a cloud account. Why would I do that? The worst ever product planning. The band is just useless now.,Huawei Health,feature_request,"**User Story:**

> As a user of the fitness band, I want the band to continue functioning as it originally did, so that my fitness tracking isn't disrupted and I don't have to deal with unexpected requirements to download additional apps or create cloud accounts that I don't want.

"I need the precentage of remaining battery of garmin instinct. If I don't have it in my watch, I hope I have it in this app",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories that capture the essence of the user review, ordered from most basic to slightly more refined:

**Option 1 (Basic):**

*   As a Garmin Instinct user, I want to see the battery percentage, so I know how much battery life is left.

**Option 2 (More specific):**

*   As a Garmin Instinct user, I want to see the remaining battery percentage on my watch or in the Garmin app, so I can monitor my battery levels and avoid unexpected power loss.

**Option 3 (Focus on the problem and solution):**

*   As a Garmin Instinct user, I'm worried about my watch unexpectedly running out of battery. I want to be able to easily see the remaining battery percentage, either on the watch itself or in a connected app, so I can plan my activities and charging.

**Option 4 (Addresses both watch and app):**

*   As a Garmin Instinct user, I want to be able to view the battery percentage:
    *   On the watch itself.
    *   If not available on the watch, in the Garmin app.
    So that I know how much battery remains and can plan accordingly.

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **User-centric:** They are told from the perspective of the Garmin Instinct user.
*   **Simple and concise:** Easy to understand and avoids technical jargon.
*   **Value-driven:**  Highlights the benefit the user receives (knowing battery life, avoiding unexpected power loss).
*   **Achievable:**  Represents a task that developers can work on.
*   **Investigative:** (Option 4) can lead to more detailed questioning of what is desired on the watch vs app if indeed it is absent on the watch.

The best option depends on the level of detail you need in your user stories. Option 3 and 4 are generally better as they provide more context about why the user wants this information.  They also hint at possible solutions (either watch display or app display).

"Lately I am very frustrated with the app. I need to pair my watch every time it lost bluetooth connection with my phone. I see people with similar complains. Hope garmin can solve this soon, otherwise I'd be forced to get a different watch. Phone: Samsung A32 Watch: Vivoactive 4",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story converted from the review, focusing on the user's perspective:

**As a Garmin Vivoactive 4 user with a Samsung A32 phone, I want my watch to automatically reconnect to my phone via Bluetooth after a connection is lost, so that I don't have to manually pair them every time, and avoid the frustration of a constantly disconnecting device.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The watch automatically reconnects to the phone after a Bluetooth connection is lost and regained (e.g., going out of range and returning).
*   The automatic reconnection process is seamless to the user, requiring no manual intervention.
*   This functionality works reliably between a Garmin Vivoactive 4 and a Samsung A32 phone.

**Why:**

*   Addresses the user's frustration with frequent manual pairing.
*   Improves the overall user experience.
*   Reduces the risk of the user switching to a competitor's product.

Can't link my watchfit as it doesnt appear in device list even after updates. Worse thing is asking for random permissions -camera location call before letting a person use the fitness band. Why is it even necessary to link the fitness band with the phone to start with? Deeply disappointed,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's the user review converted into a user story, broken down for clarity:

**As a fitness band user, I want to:**

*   **Connect my Watchfit to the app** so that I can track and analyze my fitness data.
*   **See my Watchfit appear in the device list after updates** to ensure compatibility and easy connection.
*   **Use the fitness band without mandatory phone linking at initial setup** so it can start tracking my activities immediately.

**So that:**

*   I can utilize all the features of my fitness band and achieve my fitness goals effectively.
*   I can quickly and easily pair my watch with the app after updates so that the integration of the two devices is simple.

**And I am frustrated because:**

*   **I can't link my Watchfit because it's not listed in the device list even after updating the app.**
*   **The app requests unnecessary permissions (camera, location, call access) before I can even use the fitness band.**
*   **Linking my phone to the fitness band before using it is a mandatory step**

**Therefore, I need the app to allow easy connection of my device and only ask for required permissions, maybe even allowing me to use some features of the fitness band before connecting it to my phone.** (Implied desired outcome)

Well I was keeping all my data on there and try to check my blood pressure but now I have to sign in which did refuses to let me do it,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here's the user story based on the review:

**As a user, I want to be able to access my health data (like blood pressure readings) stored in the app without being forced to sign in, so that I can quickly and easily monitor my health.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   I should be able to open the app and immediately see my saved blood pressure readings and other data.
*   The app should allow me to access my data even if it is not currently connected to the internet (if feasible).
*   If a sign-in is truly necessary (e.g., for data syncing or security reasons), the app should provide a clear and reliable way to sign in that doesn't prevent me from accessing my data.

**Problem:**

*   Currently, the app is forcing me to sign in *before* I can access my data.
*   The sign-in process is failing, preventing me from accessing *any* of my health information.

**Rationale:**

This user story highlights the user's key need: quick access to their health data. The review emphasizes the frustration caused by an unnecessary and malfunctioning sign-in process that prevents access to valuable information.

**Why:**

*   I am concerned about my privacy and security when using apps.
*   I believe that some apps are overreaching in the data they collect.
*   I want to feel in control of my personal data.
*   I will not use apps that ask for too much access of my personal data.
*   If I feel that the app provides a valuable service but I'm concerned about privacy, I'm still less likely to using it if I see a high risk in data access.

"Include a barcode/QRcode scanner beside the ""search"" field of the food  section (of scanning did packaging will retrieve nutritional information of  the food product into S-Health).",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Okay, here's the user story based on the review, broken down and clarified:

**As a health-conscious user of S-Health, I want to be able to scan a food product's barcode or QR code from within the food section so that I can quickly and easily retrieve its nutritional information to track my calorie and nutrient intake.**

**Details (Elaboration):**

*   **As a health-conscious user of S-Health**, I want to track what I eat to stay healthy.
*   **I want to be able to scan a food product's barcode or QR code**:  Instead of having to manually search for a food, I want a fast way to identify it.
*   **from within the food section**: It's most convenient to have this scanning capability right where I'm logging my food intake.
*   **so that I can quickly and easily retrieve its nutritional information**:  The scanner should automatically look up and display the calories, macros (proteins, fats, carbs), and other relevant nutrient data.
*   **to track my calorie and nutrient intake**:  Once the nutritional information is retrieved, it should seamlessly integrate with S-Health's food logging and tracking features.

**Acceptance Criteria (Examples):**

*   A barcode/QR code scanner icon is visible next to or within the search field in the S-Health ""Food"" logging/tracking section.
*   When the scanner icon is selected, the device camera is activated to enable scanning.
*   When a valid food product barcode/QR code is scanned, the S-Health database is searched for matching information.
*   If a match is found, the food's nutritional information is displayed, including (but not limited to) calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.
*   The retrieved food information can be easily added to the user's daily food log within S-Health.
*   If no match is found, the user is prompted to either try scanning again or manually enter the food information.
*   The scanner works with a variety of common barcode and QR code formats used on food packaging.

This is a more complete user story that provides context, motivation, and specific acceptance criteria needed for development.  The user benefit is clear: convenience and speed in logging food and tracking nutrition.

App is great! I always use it everytime I workout. My suggestion is that please add a support to Mi Band 4 or allow sync to Mi Fit App. That would be awesome.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting the user review into a user story, with slightly different focuses:

**Option 1 (Focus on Direct Mi Band 4 Support):**

*   **As a fitness enthusiast and loyal user of this app, I want the app to support Mi Band 4 so that I can seamlessly track my fitness data directly within the app without needing another application.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Syncing with Mi Fit):**

*   **As a fitness enthusiast and loyal user of this app, I want the app to sync with the Mi Fit app so that I can easily integrate my existing Mi Band data into my workout tracking and analysis.**

**Option 3 (Combines Both Requests):**

*   **As a fitness enthusiast and loyal user of this app, I want the app to either support Mi Band 4 directly or offer a sync function with the Mi Fit app, so that I can conveniently track and analyze my workouts using my Mi Band 4 data within this one app.**

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **""As a..."":** Clearly defines the user and their role (fitness enthusiast and loyal user).
*   **""I want..."":** States the user's desire or need (support for Mi Band or Mi Fit sync).
*   **""So that..."":** Explains the benefit the user will receive (seamless data tracking, convenient integration, etc.).

Choose the option that best aligns with the product team's priorities and strategy. If the team prefers to support Mi Band directly but the user is simply looking for integrated data tracking, Option 1 would be suitable. However, if the team's preference is to integrate with other services through existing APIs like the Mi Fit API, then Option 2 would be the better choice. Option 3 simply combines both.

"Latest version has severe connectivity issues, both to phone and external pulse band. Keeps disconnecting all the time. It's really frustrating and makes the product essentially worthless.",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the review into a user story, each with a slightly different emphasis:

**Option 1 (Focus on the primary frustration):**

*   **As a fitness enthusiast,** I need my watch to reliably maintain connectivity with my phone and heart rate monitor, **so that** I can accurately track my workouts and progress without constant interruptions. I am so frustrated by ongoing disconnections with both my phone and the pulse band that the device has become worthless for me.

**Option 2 (Focus on the impact on functionality):**

*   **As a user who relies on my smart watch to track my fitness data,** I need a stable connection to my phone and external pulse band, **so that** I can accurately record and analyze my workouts. If the device keeps disconnecting from those devices, it will render the device worthless since it is no longer able to do so.

**Option 3 (More technical focus, still from the user's POV):**

*   **As a user of the latest version of the app,** I need the software to maintain a stable Bluetooth connection with my phone and external pulse band, **so that** I can use the watch for its intended purpose and track my fitness activities without constant connection drops. Frequent disconnections make this impossible.

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **They are written from the user's perspective:** They use ""As a..."" to clearly identify the user.
*   **They state the user's need or desire:** They identify what the user wants to accomplish.
*   **They explain the benefit or reason (the ""so that"" clause):** They explain why the user wants this functionality and what problem it solves.
*   **They are concise and understandable:** They avoid technical jargon where possible and focus on the user's experience.

The best option depends on the specific context and the priorities of the development team.  Consider what angle you want to emphasize when prioritizing or planning work.

10 runs. I'm IT dim. Still learning. Wish quick start had clearer instructions. Docked a star for that. Have lost one recording. Pressed wrong key on watch. But coping and very impressed.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few options for user stories based on that review, ranging from more general to more specific, focusing on the user's key concerns:

**Option 1 (Focus on Quick Start and Beginner Friendliness - Broadest):**

*   **As a novice user who is still learning, I want the quick start guide to have clearer instructions so that I can easily begin using the app and avoid frustration.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Data Loss Prevention - Primary Concern):**

*   **As a slightly clumsy user still getting used to the interface, I want a way to prevent accidental data loss due to mis-taps or incorrect button presses so that I don't lose my recorded runs.**

**Option 3 (Combines Quick Start and Data Loss Prevention, More Specific):**

*   **As a new, less tech-savvy user, I want the quick start guide to be more intuitive, and I want safeguards in place to prevent me from accidentally deleting my run data with an inadvertent button press, so that I can confidently use the app and trust that my data is protected.**

**Explanation of Choices and Why These Work:**

*   **""As a...""**:  Defines the user persona (e.g., ""novice user"", ""IT dim"", ""new user,"" ""slightly clumsy user""). The best choice here depends on the design direction the product team is taking. A more general persona is often better.
*   **""I want...""**:  States the user's objective or need. This is core to the user story. It's based on the user stating ""wish quick start had clearer instructions"" and ""Have lost one recording. Pressed wrong key on watch.""
*   **""So that...""**:  Explains the benefit or outcome the user desires. This is optional, but it provides valuable context.  Why does the user want clearer instructions or data loss prevention? To avoid frustration, to confidently use the app, to trust that their data is protected.

**Key Considerations when Choosing:**

*   **Level of Detail**: How specific do you need to be at this stage?  The broader story allows for wider exploration of solutions.  The more specific stories guide the development team more directly.
*   **Prioritization**:  Which concern is more pressing from a product perspective? Is it *onboarding* and getting new users started smoothly, or is it *preventing data loss* that can lead to negative reviews and churn?
*   **Scope of Solution**: Does the team want to re-think the entire onboarding process, or just focus on the clarity of the quick start guide? Does the team want to look into adding a confirmation prompt before deleting data?

I would likely lean towards Option 3, unless the team would like a broader user story. This covers both the ease-of-use and data security in more detail.

*   **I want to use this app without being forced to install Huawei Mobile Services from the Huawei App Store:** This directly addresses the user's primary complaint.

It emphasizes the desire for a smooth, uncomplicated experience, which is hindered by the Huawei Mobile Services requirement. It addresses the user's implied frustration by highlighting the ""pathetic"" nature of the situation.

No way to input or modify an activity.  Have to press start/stop while in the pool. I don't want my taking a shower to be part of the exercise. ..,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few options for converting this review into user stories, depending on the focus and level of detail you want:

**Option 1 (Focus on Input/Modification):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to manually input or modify my activity data, so that I can accurately track my workouts even if the automatic tracking is not perfect.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Start/Stop Control):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to start and stop activity tracking outside of the activity itself, so that I can avoid including unintended periods like showering in my exercise data.**

**Option 3 (More Detailed and Combined):**

*   **As a swimmer, I want to be able to manually edit or input my swimming activity details, so that I'm not reliant solely on the device's automatic tracking.**
*   **As a swimmer, I want to be able to start and stop activity tracking before and after my swim, rather than only during, so that I don't accidentally include showering or changing time in my recorded exercise.**

*   **""As a...""** This identifies the user persona (e.g., a general user, a swimmer).
*   **""I want...""** This clearly states the user's goal or desire.
*   **""So that...""** This explains the benefit or reason behind the user's desire. By stating what that user needs, the development team can better address the user's need.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you need any assistance or additional User Stories.

Update ruined everything. My data is lost. Rubbish syncing and never updates my steps anymore. Disconnects every few minutes and counts nap when I'm awake. I thought it's firmware issue but turns it it's just this garbage app.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories extracted from that review, focusing on different aspects of the user's problems, and reflecting the user's frustration:

**Option 1 (Focus on Data Loss - Most Urgent):**

*   **As a user who relies on this app to track my vital data, I am devastated that the recent update has caused me to lose all my data, so that I can trust that my information is safe and reliable, and not at risk of disappearing with a simple update.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Syncing Issues):**

*   **As a user who wants to monitor my daily progress, I am frustrated that the app no longer syncs properly and doesn't update my step count, so that I can accurately track my activity levels and achieve my fitness goals.**

**Option 3 (Focus on Disconnections and Incorrect Tracking):**

*   **As a user looking for reliable health tracking, I'm extremely annoyed that the app disconnects constantly and incorrectly records my activity, like counting awake time as naps, so that I can get accurate and consistent data about my health and daily routines.**

**Option 4 (More comprehensive, covering all the main issues):**

*   **As a user, I am extremely dissatisfied with the latest update which has resulted in complete data loss, unreliable syncing of my steps, and constant disconnections that misrepresent my activity leading to incorrect data being recorded and ultimately making my data unreliable.**

**Explanation of Choices and Key Considerations:**

*   **User Focus:** Each story starts with ""As a user..."" to clearly identify the perspective.
*   **Desire/Need:** Each story includes what the user wants or needs.  This is often phrased as ""so that...""
*   **Problem:** Each story describes a specific problem the user is experiencing based on the review.
*   **Impact:** Each story hints or states what the negative consequence of the problem is.
*   **Tone:** The user's tone is critical to keep in mind. This is someone clearly frustrated. The user stories are worded to reflect this.

Choosing the ""best"" user story depends on the specific priorities of the development team. If data loss is a critical issue, then Option 1 would be the most important to address. If general functionality is the focus, opt for Option 3 or 4. It might also be beneficial to create multiple user stories to address each individual problem.

**A More Comprehensive User Story:**

The user wants to be able to decide if the trade-off is worth it based on the necessity of this permission.  The ""as I was previously able to use the app without granting this permission"" part is crucial since it highlights the user's frustration and raises suspicion.

**Option 1 (Focus on the Problem/Pain):**

*   **As a** sleep app user,

*   **""I want..."" (Goal/Need):**  States what the user is trying to accomplish.
*   **""So that..."" (Benefit/Reason):** Explains why the user needs this.  It highlights the value the feature provides.

The ""simple update"" comment from the original review is *intentionality* left out. User stories should focus on *what* the user needs, and *why*. How the need is met (the ""how"") is up to the development team.  Calling it a ""simple update"" could potentially bias the development team toward a specific (and possibly incorrect) solution.

Choosing the best option depends on the context of your project and the level of detail you need in your user stories.  Option 3 is the most explicit, whereas Option 1 is a little more open to interpretation (which could be good or bad, depending).

"Overall, I really like this app. I have agree with others, I was very upset to see the weight control tab on the home screen was removed. This was my primary guide to losing 50 pounds so far this year. Please bring this back feature back really fast!",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Okay, here's a user story based on the provided user review, written from the user's perspective:

**As a user trying to manage my weight and having successfully lost 50 pounds using the app, I want the ""Weight Control"" tab to be restored to the home screen, so I can easily continue to track my progress and stay on track towards my weight loss goals.**

Improve ur app man and add some more features to smartwatch ui it getting boring add camera shutter and voice assistant and add feature to stop continues heart rate monitor change navigation animation and add drink water reminder etc,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's the user review converted into multiple user stories, broken down for clarity and focusing on the ""As a [user], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]"" format:

**1. Smartwatch UI Enhancement:**

*   **As a Smartwatch user, I want the UI to be more engaging and less boring, so that I enjoy interacting with my smartwatch and find it more useful.** (This addresses the general sentiment of boredom)

**2. Camera Shutter Control:**

*   **As a Smartwatch user, I want to be able to control my phone's camera shutter from my smartwatch, so that I can take photos remotely and more conveniently, especially when taking group photos or selfies.**

**3. Voice Assistant Integration:**

*   **As a Smartwatch user, I want to be able to use a voice assistant (like Siri/Google Assistant/Alexa) on my smartwatch, so that I can quickly access information, control my smart home devices, and perform hands-free tasks.**

**4. On-Demand Heart Rate Monitoring:**
*   **As a Smartwatch user, I want the option to stop continuous heart rate monitoring, so that I can conserve battery life when I don't need constant readings.**

**5. Navigation Animation Improvement:**

*   **As a Smartwatch user, I want more engaging/smooth/aesthetic navigation animations on my smartwatch, so that the overall user experience feels more polished and modern.** (You could elaborate on what constitutes an improved animation in the acceptance criteria).

**6. Drink Water Reminder:**

*   **As a Smartwatch user, I want a drink water reminder feature on my smartwatch, so that I can stay hydrated throughout the day and improve my overall health.**

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:**  While the original review was broad, the user stories break down the requests into actionable features.
*   **User Value:** Each story clearly articulates *why* the user wants the feature (the ""so that"" part).
*   **Testability:** These stories are much easier for developers to understand and estimate than the original review. Each story would then need to be further refined by adding more specific acceptance criteria (e.g., ""The camera shutter control should work with the native camera app"" or ""The drink water reminder should allow customizable intervals"").
*   **Prioritization:**  Product owners can prioritize these stories based on user impact and development effort. They might even want to further break them down into smaller stories based on complexity.  For example, the Voice Assistant integration could be split into stories for each assistant.

"I've had this before & lost an entire person by just walking 10,000 steps a day, but I'd actually topped it by 4000 extra steps so I'm happy to try to lose again so my surgeries go better than expected.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user stories that could be derived from that review, depending on the nuance you want to focus on.  The first is the most direct interpretation and the others offer slightly different angles:

**Option 1 (Focus on the Goal and Past Success):**

*   **As a person preparing for surgeries, I want to use this product to achieve significant weight loss by walking a large number of steps daily, so that my surgeries have a better outcome.** (Based on ""I'm happy to try to lose again so my surgeries go better than expected."")

**Option 2 (Focus on the Proven Effectiveness):**

*   **As someone who has previously succeeded in losing weight with this product, I want to use it again because it allowed me to achieve significant weight loss by walking, so that I can improve my health before my upcoming surgeries.** (Based on ""I've had this before & lost an entire person by just walking 10,000 steps a day"")

**Option 3 (More Specific, Focus on exceeding previous performance):**

*   **As a returning user who previously had great weight loss success, I want to surpass my previous daily step count to exceed my past weight loss results, so that my upcoming surgeries have the best possible outcome.** (Based on ""I've had this before & lost an entire person by just walking 10,000 steps a day, but I'd actually topped it by 4000 extra steps"")

**Explanation of the Choices:**

*   **""As a... I want... so that...""** This is the classic user story format.
*   **Focus:** Each option emphasizes a slightly different aspect of the user's statement. This is because the original review is a bit fragmented and filled with implied information.  Choose the option that best reflects the aspect you want to prioritize in your product development or feature prioritization.
*   **""Lose an entire person"":** I interpreted this as significant weight loss. This phrasing is used to avoid being overly literal.
*   **Assumptions Made:** Assumed ""this product"" refers to a product somehow related to tracking weight or steps (or both)

Choose the user story that best fits your particular needs.  You might even combine elements from several of them.

After the last update the ecg stopped working it requires an update that according to the msg is not compatible with the zfold3 or watch 4 (com.samsung.android.shealthmonitor:2290:9908:25bc597b6003) Tried to get help and no response so far.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"**As a Samsung Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Watch 4 user who relies on the ECG feature through the Samsung Health Monitor app, I want the ECG functionality to work correctly after app updates, so that I can continue to monitor my heart health without interruption or encountering compatibility issues.**

**Explanation of the elements:**

*   **As a...:** Specifies the user -  ""Samsung Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Watch 4 user who relies on the ECG feature through the Samsung Health Monitor app""
*   **I want...:** Specifies the desire - ""the ECG functionality to work correctly after app updates""
*   **So that...:** Specifies the benefit/reason - ""I can continue to monitor my heart health without interruption or encountering compatibility issues.""

This story focuses on the user experiencing the problem and the motivation behind needing the feature to work.  The technical detail of the specific update version (com.samsung.android.shealthmonitor:2290:9908:25bc597b6003) would be included in the acceptance criteria for the developer.  Similarly, the lack of support response is a separate, but related, issue that *could* be another user story:  ""As a user with a malfunctioning Samsung Health Monitor app, I want to receive prompt and helpful support, so that I can quickly resolve any issues I encounter.""

App removed. As i reject the conditions of their required permission to  access phone and much others before using app.. idiots. I must see and  review app details before giving any access or permissions. Need a  professional and wise app management to gain users' trust,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's the user review converted into a user story:

**As a user, I want to review a complete list of required permissions and understand why they are necessary *before* granting any access or permissions, so that I can make an informed decision about whether I trust the app and want to use it.**

**Explanation of Breakdown:**

*   **""As a user...""**: This identifies the user role.
*   **""...I want to...""**: This specifies what the user desires or needs.
*   **""...review a complete list of required permissions and understand why they are necessary *before* granting any access or permissions...""**: This captures the main point of the review – that the user wants to see permissions *before* providing them.
*   **""...so that I can make an informed decision about whether I trust the app and want to use it.""**: This focuses on the user's motivation – to make a thoughtful, informed trust decision based on the permission requests.

**Key Takeaways from the Original Review that the User Story Reflects:**

*   **Rejection of Permissions:** The user clearly rejected the permission requests as unacceptable.
*   **Need for Transparency:** The user wants full details _before_ giving access.
*   **Trust is Key:** The user mentions needing professional app management in order to gain their trust. The user wants to know that their privacy is being respected

This user story captures the core sentiment of the original review in a structured and actionable format. It allows developers to address the user's concerns about transparency and control over permissions.

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   I can easily download GPX files to my device without needing a PC.
        *   Temperature readings are shown to one decimal place for improved accuracy.

**Explanation of Choices and Why Variations Matter:**

*   **""As a ... I want ... so that..."" structure:** This is the standard user story format.  It clarifies the user's role, their goal, and the benefit they receive.
*   **Focus:** Each version prioritizes slightly different aspects of the feedback.  The ""best"" version depends on how the product team wants to frame the issue.
*   **Specificity:** The second version is more specific and has two user stories. This is useful if separate development tasks are needed.
*   **""Without needing a PC"":**  This phrase reflects the core user need in the original review for users who do not have access to a PC.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**  These are *crucial*.  They define when the user story is considered ""done"" and working correctly.

Which version you choose depends on your project's specific needs and how granular you want to be with your requirements. The first version is probably the most concise and broadly applicable.

My sleep data is not getting synced from band to app. How do I fix this. It's been three days I have bought the band.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"**User Story:**

As a **new user of the fitness band (purchased 3 days ago)**,
I want **my sleep data to automatically sync from my band to the app**,
So that **I can easily track and analyze my sleep patterns to improve my sleep quality**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The sleep data recorded by the band should be automatically synced to the app within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within a few minutes to an hour of waking up).
*   If the sleep data is not syncing, the app should provide clear troubleshooting steps or guidance on how to fix the issue.
*   The user should be able to manually sync their sleep data if automatic syncing fails.

"I like this app, except it keeps crashing when I try to link other apps to my Samsung Health, causing me to enter the same data in two different places.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few versions of a user story converted from the user review, each with a slightly different emphasis:

**Option 1 (Focus on the core problem):**

*   **As a** Samsung Health user
*   **I want** to be able to link other apps to Samsung Health without the app crashing
*   **So that** I don't have to manually enter the same data in multiple places.

**Option 2 (Broader focus on frustration):**

*   **As a** Samsung Health user
*   **I want** to have a reliable and stable experience when using the app to link with other apps
*   **So that** I am not frustrated by crashes and can easily manage my health data in one central location.

**Option 3 (More detail, focusing on the action):**

*   **As a** Samsung Health user
*   **I want** the app to stop crashing when I attempt to link it to other applications
*   **So that** I can consolidate my data within Samsung Health and avoid the tedious task of duplicate data entry.

**Why these work:**

*   **Follows the ""As a...I want...So that..."" format:**  This is the standard format for user stories, keeping the focus on the user's needs and motivations.
*   **Uses the user's language:**  It captures the essence of their complaint (crashing, duplicate data entry).
*   **Provides context:**  It clearly states that the user is a Samsung Health user and identifies the specific issue within that context.

The best option depends on the level of detail required for your project.  If the team already understands the context well, Option 1 might be sufficient.  If you need to emphasize the frustration, Option 2 might be better. Option 3 is often the most clear-cut.

"Km count is totally wrong-where in reality I have 15 m,app counted 2 km!!  Pedometer too not trustable,walked with friend the same amount-very long  distance,I had ~12000 steps, she - 30000. At the end of the walk different  notifications about different length.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user stories derived from the user review, focusing on different aspects of the problem:

**User Story 1 (Focus on Distance Accuracy):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to accurately track the distance I've walked, so that I can trust the app's measurements and use them for fitness tracking and goal setting.

**User Story 2 (Focus on Step Count Accuracy):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to accurately count my steps, so that I can get a reliable representation of my physical activity and compare it to my friends or my past performance.

**User Story 3 (Focus on Consistency and Reliability):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to consistently and reliably track my activity metrics (distance, steps), so that I can be confident in the information the app provides and not be surprised by vastly different measurements compared to others.

**User Story 4 (Focus on Notification Accuracy):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to send me accurate and consistent notifications about my activity, so I can trust the feedback and achieve my goals.

**Combined User Story (Encompassing all issues):**

*   **As a user exercising with friends,** I want the application to accurately track metrics (distance through kilometer tracking and steps through the pedometer), give reliable data I can trust along with my friends exercise data, and send consistent notifications to ensure I understand my progress made.

**Rationale for the Choices:**

*   **""As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"" format:**  This standard format helps to clearly define the user, their desired outcome, and the reason behind it.
*   **Specificity:** The stories focus on the described issues (inaccurate distance, inaccurate step count, inconsistent measurements, and notification errors.)
*   **User-Centric:**  The stories are written from the user's point of view, using ""I"" rather than technical jargon.
*   **Measurable Implication:** The ""so that"" clauses imply that the improvement can be measured in terms of the user's trust, confidence, and ability to achieve fitness goals.

Which user story is best depends on the specific focus of the development team. If they are tackling all the issues at once, the Combined User story may be the best, to ensure engineers, designers, and product managers do not forget any area of concern.

"Pretty comprehensive with it's data. The data screens are all well presented and easy to read. The app itself can be a little odd to navigate, but once you've sorted it out, it's not too bad.",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here's a user story based on the review, reflecting the user's perspective:

**As a user, I want to easily find the data I need within the app so I can quickly understand the insights, even if the overall navigation takes a little getting used to.**

Here's a breakdown of why this story addresses the review:

*   **""Pretty comprehensive with its data""** -  The phrase ""find the data I need"" encompasses this. The user needs the data to be comprehensively present for them to benefit.
*   **""The data screens are all well presented and easy to read""** -  This is covered by ""easily understand the insights"". Well-presented and readable screens contribute directly to easy understanding.
*   **""The app itself can be a little odd to navigate, but once you've sorted it out, it's not too bad""** - This is acknowledged with ""even if the overall navigation takes a little getting used to"". This shows awareness of the issue but focuses on the positive outcome of being able to understand the data.
*   **""quickly understand the insights""** - This implies efficiency for the user.

This user story captures the essence of the review, focusing on the user's need to access and understand the data quickly and easily, despite a slightly clunky navigation experience.

Wants access to make phone calls. Won't open without it. Upd: The answer regarding providing optimal experience is ot an answer at all. I don't need an experience when an app makes phone calls for me.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story based on the provided review, broken down and explained:

**User Story:**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to function even if I don't grant it access to make phone calls, because I don't want the app making phone calls on my behalf.

**Explanation of Elements and Reasoning:**

*   **As a user:**  Establishes the perspective.  We're seeing this from the point of view of someone using the app, not a developer or admin.
*   **I want the app to function even if I don't grant it access to make phone calls:** This directly addresses the core issue.  The user is frustrated that the app ""Won't open without it [phone call permission].""  The desired outcome is for the app to work *regardless* of granting these permissions.
*   **because I don't want the app making phone calls on my behalf:** This captures the 'Upd' part of the review. This expresses the *reason* for not granting the permission. The user doesn't want an app initiating calls automatically. They are suspicious of the app's intentions.

**Why this is a good user story:**

*   **Clear and Concise:** It's easy to understand what the user wants.
*   **Value-focused:** It highlights the user's need for control and privacy.
*   **Testable:**  Developers can test whether the app functions (or has expected limitations) when the phone call permission is denied.
*   **Actionable:** It gives developers a specific problem to solve.

**Alternative, Slightly More Detailed User Story (Adding Context):**

*   **As a user who values control over my phone's functionality and my data privacy,** I want the app to function core features (e.g. [list non-phone call features]) even if I don't grant it permission to access my phone calls, because I am uncomfortable with apps initiating phone calls without my explicit consent and I don't believe it's necessary for the app to even function.

This second version is stronger because of the added context. However, depending on your teams internal working procedures, the added text may not be appropriate.

I do not work out and it keep tell nice work or I'm on a bicycle and it been 4 years for that. Something need fix ASAP,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, let's turn that user review into a user story.  Here are a few options, depending on the focus you want to highlight:

**Option 1 (Focus on Inaccurate Activity Detection):**

*   **As a** non-active user,
*   **I want** the app to accurately detect when I am *not* exercising,
*   **So that** I am not falsely congratulated for workouts I haven't done or misrepresented activities when I'm doing something else.

**Option 2 (Focus on Outdated/Stuck Data):**

*   **As a** user who used to track bicycle activities,
*   **I want** the app to stop incorrectly attributing all activity to cycling,
*   **So that** the app accurately reflects my current activity (or lack thereof) and provides relevant data.

**Option 3 (More Direct, Focusing on Urgency):**

*   **As a** user of this app (whether I'm active or not),
*   **I want** the app to accurately reflect my current activity level and not report false data or assume the same activity from years ago,
*   **So that** the app provides credible information to me and is not misleading.

**Explanation of Choices & Why These are Better User Stories:**

*   **Follows the ""As a... I want... So that..."" Format:**  This is the standard user story template, making it clear who the user is, what they want, and why.
*   **User-Centric Language:**  Avoids technical jargon and puts the emphasis on the user's experience.
*   **Actionable:**  Provides a clear goal that developers can address.
*   **Addresses the Core Issue:** Each option tackles the central problems expressed in the review: inaccurate tracking, false congratulations, and outdated data.
*   **Implied Urgency:** While not directly stating ""ASAP"" in the user story, the urgency is inherently communicated by the issues being addressed. The issue is about integrity in the data.

**Why these are better than a simple restatement of the review:**

Simply rephrasing the review doesn't provide enough context or clarity. The user story format forces you to think about the user's motivation and the desired outcome, which is crucial for the development team to understand and address the problem effectively.

I'll break them down into different focuses:

**Focusing on Language Pack Download:**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to download the language pack easily and without errors, so I can use the app in my preferred language.**

**Focusing on REM Sleep Tracking:**

*   **As a user, I want the app to accurately record my REM sleep cycles, so I can gain insights into my sleep quality and make informed decisions about my health.**

*   **As a user, I want the app to seamlessly integrate with MyFitnessPal, so I can easily share my health and fitness data between platforms and track my progress in one place.**

**Combined and Prioritized (Based on implied urgency and impact):**

Here's a more concise list, likely prioritized by the user's frustration, and consolidating some similar requests:

1.  **As a user, I want the heart rate monitor to function correctly, so I can rely on it for accurate readings during my activities.**
2.  **As a user, I want the language pack to download successfully, so I can use the app in my preferred language.**
3.  **As a user, I want the app to accurately track my REM sleep cycles, so I can gain better insights into my sleep patterns.**
4.  **As a user, I want the app to integrate with MyFitnessPal, so I can easily share my data and track my fitness in one place.**
5.  **As a user, I want the app to have a more modern and visually appealing design, so it's more enjoyable to use.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Specificity:**  I've tried to make the ""why"" clear in each story so developers understand the value to the user.
*   **Focus on Goal:** Each story focuses on what the *user* wants to achieve, not how the developers should achieve it.
*   **Language:** I've kept the language simple and accessible, reflecting the tone of the original review.
*   **Prioritization (Estimating from Feedback):**
    *   I placed the heart rate monitor first as ""not working"" is a serious issue.
    *   Download is also an immediate blocking issue.
    *   REM tracking is also a fairly critical function
    *   Integration and design are important, but probably less critical blocking issues than the functional problems.

When deciding which user stories to act on the product team should be the ones prioritizing."

"The App is fine for Heart Rate measuring but why does the Stress Measuring always stuck at ""measuring"" or ""finalising"" for more than 30min?  For 2 years it's never measured ! !! Explain please before I remove one star!  It's really frustrating I can't take the SpO2",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories derived from the user review, with slightly different focuses:

**Option 1 (Focus on Stress Measurement Functionality):**

*   **As a user,** I want the stress measurement feature to function reliably and provide a result, **so that** I can accurately track and manage my stress levels, **rather than** having the process perpetually stuck in ""measuring"" or ""finalizing"" for an unreasonable amount of time.

**Option 2 (Focus on Overall Reliability and Value):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app's advertised features, especially the stress and SpO2 measurement capabilities, to work correctly and reliably, **so that** I can get full value out of the app and trust its functionality, **instead of** feeling frustrated by consistently broken features and being tempted to downgrade my rating.

**Option 3 (More Specific and Actionable):**

*   **As a user,** I want the stress measurement to either successfully complete within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., a few minutes) or provide a clear error message if it cannot, **so that** I don't waste my time waiting indefinitely and wondering if the app is broken.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a user"":** This clearly indicates the perspective.
*   **""I want"":** This specifies the desired functionality or outcome.
*   **""So that"":** This explains the user's motivation or benefit.
*   **""Instead of"" / ""Rather Than"":** Highlights the negative experience the user is currently facing.

Which user story is best depends on the specific goals of the product team.  Option 1 is good if the priority is fixing the stress measurement.  Option 2 is a broader story about overall app value. Option 3 is very direct with the desired outcome. It also provides a specific action the developers can immediately work on.

*   **As a user of the Huawei Health app, I miss the specific ""20K/day steps cheer"" notification, so I want to ensure that specific notifications I find useful are still available and controllable after the EMUI update.**

*   **As a user of the Huawei Health app after the EMUI update, I was forced to disable all notifications, so I want more granular control over the types of notifications I receive, so I can keep helpful notifications without being bombarded by unhelpful ones.**

*   We try to infer the user's motivation. We see that the user is frustrated by the inaccurate tracking and wants accurate data to help them with their fitness goals.

"I have changed my mobile phone, to redmi note10, now my cycling could not be tracked by this app. I'm using Huawei band 2. No response from Huawei Health team today is 19 Feb. 2022",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories, prioritizing a few key aspects that could be derived from this review. Choose the one that best captures the intended meaning:

**Option 1 (Focus on core functionality):**

*   **As a cyclist with a new Redmi Note 10 phone and a Huawei Band 2, I want the app to track my cycling activities so that I can continue to monitor my performance and progress.**

**Option 2 (Focus on compatibility and breakage upon change):**

*   **As a user of this app and a Huawei Band 2, I want the app to remain compatible with my fitness tracker even after I changed my mobile phone to a Redmi Note 10, so that I am not forced to buy a new tracker or find new apps.**

**Option 3 (Includes the aspect of support and timeline):**

*   **As a cyclist who recently switched to a Redmi Note 10 and a Huawei Band 2, I am frustrated that the app is no longer tracking my cycling activities, and I expected a response from Huawei Health support within a reasonable timeframe (like within the day of 19 Feb 2022) to help me resolve the issue.**

**Explanation and Considerations:**

*   **""As a... I want... so that..."" format:** All options follow the standard user story format.
*   **Perspective:** All are written from the user's perspective.
*   **Option 1:** This is the most concise and focuses on the core need: tracking the cycling activity.  The ""so that"" part highlights the *why* (monitoring progress).
*   **Option 2:** Emphasizes the importance of continued compatibility even when a device changes.  This speaks to the robustness of the app.
*   **Option 3:** This includes the frustration and unmet expectation of support, which is valuable if the team wants to address support responsiveness as well. The date ""19 Feb. 2022"" is important for pinpointing the issue.

Choose the option that best fits the priorities and goals of the development team.  If compatibility is a major focus, Option 2 might be best. If the core need for activity tracking is paramount, use Option 1.  If support response time is being analyzed, go with Option 3.

"Permanent notification with vivofit 4 is a no go! The connection can only be initiated with the watch, so the app does not have to be active in background!",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story, derived from the user review, focusing on the user's perspective:

**As a user of the vivofit 4, I want to receive notifications on my phone reliably without constantly running the Garmin Connect app in the background, so that I can conserve my phone's battery and data usage.**

*   **""As a user of the vivofit 4""**: Establishes the user role and context.
*   **""I want to receive notifications on my phone reliably""**: This addresses the implicit need for notifications to work correctly. The review implies that *permanent* notifications are desired, and they're not currently working as the user expects.

*   **""so that I can conserve my phone's battery and data usage""**: This describes the *benefit* to the user. A background app consumes power and potentially data, which the user wants to avoid.

This user story captures the problem the user is experiencing based on their review. It's now in a standard format that a development team can use to understand and address the issue. The statement ""The connection can only be initiated with the watch, so the app does not have to be active in background!"" is now the *reason* and technical assumption behind this user story.

Works great! The app won't let you graph all the different exercises the watch offers. But over all it's a great app and I like the way you can download each exercise.,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few versions of the user story, based on slightly different interpretations of the review, trying to capture the intent and priority:

When I'm in the car it counts steps and eventually says my target is reached!it's not right at least we should always be carefull to turn it off when on the car.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story based on the provided review:

**As a user, I want the step tracking feature to accurately reflect my activity, so that I receive reliable data and don't get false notifications about reaching my step goal while driving.**

Here's a breakdown of why this is a good user story:

*   Implementing an algorithm to detect and filter out steps taken while driving.
*   Providing a more prominent and accessible way to pause or disable step tracking while in a vehicle.
*   Improving the sensitivity of the step tracking to minimize false positives."

"Smart notifications don't function unless the App is running. I.e. Garmin insist on having their spying, battery draining App open on your personal phone ALL THE TIME. Don't buy a Garmin watch unless you want them to record everything about you, not just the exercise you do.",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story, broken down to try and capture the essence of the review:

**As a privacy-conscious user**,

**I want my Garmin watch to deliver smart notifications reliably even when the Garmin Connect app is not actively running in the foreground or background**

**So that I can receive timely updates without having to keep the app constantly open, which I believe is a privacy violation and drains my phone's battery.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   I receive all expected smart notifications on my Garmin watch (e.g., calls, texts, calendar events) even when the Garmin Connect app is closed or running only intermittently.
*   My phone's battery life is not significantly impacted by the Garmin Connect app running in the background to support notifications.
*   I do not feel like I need to compromise my privacy to receive the intended notifications provided by the Garmin device.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Privacy-Conscious User:**  This encapsulates the user's key concern expressed in the review: being spied on and feeling like their data is being unnecessarily collected.
*   **Reliable Notifications:**  Addresses the core issue - the notifications only working when the app is open.
*   **Without Keeping App Open:** Emphasizes the user's desire not to have the app constantly running due to privacy and battery concerns.
*   **Privacy Violation and Battery Drain:** Directly reflects two of the user's most prominent complaints.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** The acceptance criteria provides clear and measurable conditions for determining whether the story has been implemented correctly and meets the user's expectations.  The ""significant impact"" on battery life is deliberately vague, as ""significant"" would need to be defined through testing and user feedback.

**Important Note:**  This story tries to address the *user's* perspective. It doesn't delve into the technical reasons *why* Garmin requires the app to be running (which is likely related to connection management, background processes, or data syncing).  The development team would need to investigate the technical feasibility of operating without the app running constantly.

**Option 4 (Combining the Most Important Issues):**

*   **As a user with a Huawei Band 3 Pro, I want the app to sync my steps and accurately display data on the home screen, so that I can trust the app to track my activity after an update.**

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **User-Centric:**  They are written from the user's perspective (""As a user..."")

*   **Value-Driven:** They hint at the value to the user (knowing their activity, feeling confident in the app).
*   **Concise:** They are short and easy to understand.

**Recommendation:**

Choose the option that best reflects the primary problem the development team needs to address first.  Option 4 is probably the most comprehensive, but if the syncing issue is demonstrably worse, Option 1 might be prioritized.

Actually the update does not even have much form.....Samsung took a helpful and useful app and turned it into a pile of poop. Please roll back to the previous version and whoever said this new version was any good...sack them.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few variations of user stories based on that review, escalating in detail and capturing the user's intent and frustration:

**Option 1 (Simple & Direct):**

*   **As a user of the app, I want the previous version restored because the current update has significantly degraded the app's usability and value for me.**

**Option 2 (More Specific about the Problem):**

*   **As a user of the app, I want the previous version restored because the update removed features and functionality that I found helpful and useful, making the app now feel like a significant downgrade.**

**Option 3 (Detailed and Emphasizing Impact):**

*   **As a user who relied on the app for [briefly state what you relied on it for, if known/assumed - e.g., ""managing my photos,"" ""tracking my health data,"" etc.], I am extremely frustrated because the new update has made the app unusable due to [mention a primary issue you can infer from ""pile of poop"" - e.g., ""poor design,"" ""unintuitive interface,"" ""broken features""]. I want the previous version reinstated so I can continue using the app effectively.**

**Option 4 (More explicit, but could be considered too harsh for internal use - use with caution):**

*   **As a loyal user of this app, I am extremely disappointed and angry that the update has completely ruined it. I want the previous version of the app back immediately because the current version is worthless and a massive step backwards.**

**Key Considerations When Choosing:**

*   **Audience:** Are these stories for internal development teams? For external stakeholders? Tailor the tone accordingly. The ""sack them"" sentiment is not appropriate for direct use, but the intensity of the user's feeling *is* useful information.
*   **Level of Detail:** How much context does the team need? If the ""helpful and useful"" aspects are well-understood, a simpler story might suffice. If the team needs reminders of what those valuable features were, add details.
*   **Actionable Information:** The best user stories point towards specific actions.  So, if you can infer *specific* problems from ""pile of poop"" (interface issues, bugs, missing features, etc.), it's helpful to include those.

In general, I'd recommend **Option 2 or 3**, depending on how much detail the development team needs. They are respectful yet communicates the user's strong negative feedback and desire for the previous version.  Remember to follow up with the user (if possible) to get more specifics about *why* they dislike the update.

*   **As a user upgrading from a Galaxy Note 9, I expect the health tracking features, including heart rate and pulse oximetry (pulse ox) measurement, to be at least as functional on my new Galaxy S20, and ideally more accurate, so that I don't lose valuable functionality when upgrading and I can have more confidence in the data.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a user...""**:  This clearly identifies the person benefiting from the feature.
*   **""I want...""**: This states the user's desired outcome.
*   **""So that...""**: This explains the reason the user desires the functionality – the benefit they'll receive.

The most appropriate user story depends on the overall goals and focus of the project.

*   **Option 1** is a good starting point if heart rate/pulse ox measuring is intended functionality.
*   **Option 2** highlights accuracy issues. If the product prioritizes providing reliable health tracking, this might be the better choice.
*   **Option 3** is more appropriate if the team needs to consider backward compatibility and ensure that upgrades provide a better experience, not a degraded one.

Unable to reset password. Sup wants me to input details of a phone I had in 2010. Maybe I'm different but I don't have any info on that device except the name,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story conversion, focusing on the user's perspective and using standard user story format:

**As a user, I want to be able to easily reset my password with verification methods I can reliably access, so I can regain access to my account quickly and securely without having to recall obscure or outdated information.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   I can reset my password using an alternative method (e.g., email, current phone number, security questions) if I don't remember the information about a device I used many years ago.
*   The reset password process does not rely exclusively on information about outdated devices I may no longer possess or remember details about.
*   The password reset process should be designed to balance security with user convenience.

**Additional Notes (for developers):**

*   The original review suggests the current password reset process is asking for information about a device from 2010, which is likely problematic for many users.
*   Consider offering a variety of verification methods to cater to different user preferences and situations.
*   Prioritize modern verification methods that users are more likely to have readily accessible (e.g., email, SMS on a current phone).
*   Review the password recovery flows to ensure they are secure but not overly burdensome for returning users who may have forgotten their passwords.

I just got the note 20 and now i can't use the heart rate or stress . I can do the ones i have to do manually but anything else won't work.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the user review into User Stories, each focusing on slightly different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on Core Functionality):**

*   **As a** new Samsung Note 20 user,
*   **I want** the heart rate and stress monitoring features to work automatically,
*   **So that** I can easily track my health metrics without manual input.

**Option 2 (Emphasis on Broken Legacy):**

*   **As a** Samsung user upgrading to the Note 20,
*   **I want** the automatic heart rate and stress monitoring features (that worked on my previous device) to function properly,
*   **So that** I don't lose existing functionality when upgrading to a newer phone.

**Option 3 (More Specific Diagnosis):**

*   **As a** new Samsung Note 20 user,
*   **I want** automatic heart rate and stress monitoring to work,
*   **So that** I can use the built-in health features without having to manually perform the readings.  I've got the feature to do it manually but am unable to do it automatically.

**Explanation of Choices & Considerations:**

*   **""As a...""**:  This always establishes the user role.  The review clearly identifies them as a user of a new Note 20.  Option 2 also identifies them as an *upgrading* user, highlighting the potential issue of regression.
*   **""I want...""**: This states the user's *goal*. In this case, it's functional: to have the automatic heart rate and stress features operational.
*   **""So that...""**:  This explains the *value* or *benefit* the user receives. This is important because it gives context to *why* they want the feature.  It could be for general health tracking, data consistency, or simply to maintain functionality they previously had. The key is to understand WHY the user wants the feature.
*   **Specificity**:  Option 3 is more specific, making clear which feature work but not automatically.

**Ultimately, the best User Story depends on the specific context of your project and what aspect of the problem you want to emphasize.** If you know the user is upgrading from a previous Samsung phone, Option 2 might be most informative. If you're prioritizing core functionality first, Option 1 would be suitable. If understanding where it works and where it does not, Option 3 may be the best route.

**Option 3 (More Comprehensive, combining both needs):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to open and work like it used to, so I can access and use my data without fear of losing it due to crashes.**

**Breaking down each option, we can highlight the different priorities:**

*   **Option 1:** Prioritizes immediately getting basic functionality back. Good for a team focused on a quick fix.
*   **Option 2:** Prioritizes data security and integrity. Good if the team knows data loss is a major concern.
*   **Option 3:** Covers both functionalities and Data.

**Why include the ""So that..."" part? (Optional Enhancement):**

Adding the ""so that..."" clause specifies the *reason* for the feature request, providing more context for developers.

For example:

*   **As a user, I want the app to open and work like it used to, so that I can continue my work/enjoy the app/manage my [affected area] without interruption and without losing my data.**

The best option depends on the specific context and goals of the development team. All of these options communicate the essentials of the user's problem in a user story format. Regardless of the option you choose, it is always critical that the development team has enough information to provide a working solution.

"still not fixed :( Google fit syncs sleep now. does not sync heart and sports info. pls allow us to add our own activities info captured on honor band does not include steps climbed. pls have find my band feature, and also band to auto track exercise",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of the review and its conversion into user stories from the user's perspective:

**Analyzing the Review:**

The user is expressing frustration with several issues related to their Honor Band and its connection to Google Fit.  They are experiencing a mix of successful syncing (sleep data) and failures (heart rate and activity data). They also have feature requests related to customizable activity tracking, step counting (specifically steps climbed), finding their band, and automatic exercise tracking.

**User Stories:**

Here's the review broken down into several user stories, from the user's perspective:

*   **As a user, I want my heart rate data from my Honor Band to sync with Google Fit so I can track my cardiovascular health over time.**  (Addresses the heart rate sync issue)

*   **As a user, I want my sports/activity data from my Honor Band to sync with Google Fit so I can have a complete record of my workouts and fitness activities in one place.** (Addresses the sports data sync issue)

*   **As a user, I want to be able to manually add custom activity information (e.g., specific exercises, durations, etc.) captured on my Honor Band, but not automatically synced, so I can have a complete and accurate fitness log.** (Addresses the request for custom activity logging)

*   **As a user, I want my Honor Band to track the number of steps I climb each day, so I can accurately monitor my daily activity and effort expended.** (Addresses the request for steps climbed tracking)

*   **As a user, I want a ""Find My Band"" feature so I can easily locate my Honor Band if I misplace it.** (Addresses the ""Find My Band"" request)

*   **As a user, I want my Honor Band to automatically detect and track when I start exercising, so I don't have to manually start and stop tracking my workouts.** (Addresses the request for auto exercise tracking)

**Why this works:**

*   **User-focused:** Each story starts with ""As a user..."" putting the emphasis on the user's needs.
*   **Clear Goal**: Each story includes ""I want..."" to specify the desired outcome.
*   **Benefit/Rationale:** Each story includes ""so that..."" or ""so I can..."" to explain why the user wants the feature and what benefit they will receive.

This set of user stories provides specific and actionable requirements for the development team to address the user's concerns and feature requests.

"Sleep stats are way to conservative since some time (nearly always they require an edit to add sleep time). Also, the app does not want to sync watch data without internet connection - why? What about trying to sync in a remote location out of range?",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Okay, here are two user stories extracted from that review, written from the user's perspective:

**User Story 1: Issue with Sleep Tracking**

*   **As a user,** I want my sleep stats to accurately reflect the time I am asleep,
*   **so that** I can trust the data recorded by the app and gain valuable insights into my sleep patterns.
*   **Currently,** the app often underestimates my sleep time, requiring me to manually edit the data, which is frustrating and time-consuming.

**User Story 2: Issue with Offline Syncing**

*   **As a user,** I want to be able to sync my watch data with the app even when I don't have an internet connection,
*   **so that** my data is saved and up-to-date (especially when I'm in remote locations).
*   **Currently,** the app forces internet sync and I can't sync my watch data without an internet connection which prevents me from tracking progress in remote locations.

**Explanation of the User Story format (""As a... I want... so that..."")**

*   **As a...**: This describes the user role or type of person who wants the feature.
*   **I want...**: This states what the user wants to achieve.
*   **So that...**:  This explains the benefit or the reason why the user wants the feature. It captures the value or goal the user is trying to achieve.

"Whatever update came through had permanently disconnected my vivoactive 3 . Irritating. Uninstalled app and reinstalled it, reset to watch to factory settings. Thanks for making my not so cheap watch useless.",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Okay, here's a user story based on the review, written from the user's perspective:

**As a Vivoactive 3 user, I want to be able to rely on updates to the Garmin Connect app to improve my watch's functionality, not to experience problems, so that my watch continues to work as expected and I don't have to waste time troubleshooting.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   After any app update, my Vivoactive 3 should remain connected to the Garmin Connect app.
*   App updates should not cause disconnection issues that require factory resets or uninstall/reinstall the app.
*   App updates should not render my watch unusable.

**Additional Notes/Context (derived from the review):**

*   The user experienced a complete disconnection of their watch.
*   The user had to try several troubleshooting steps (uninstall/reinstall app, factory reset) to try to fix the issue.
*   The user is frustrated because they consider the watch a significant investment and it has been rendered ""useless.""

Tha app ALWAYS crashes and drains the battery. It take forever to sync up right with my Samsung watch. It will sync but the data won't match! So I have to do EVERYTHING twice????????,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user story options derived from the user review, focusing on different aspects of the reported problems:

**Option 1 (Focus on Crashing and Battery Drain):**

*   **As a user who relies on this app for [mention specific purpose, if known, e.g., tracking workouts], I want the app to be stable and not drain my phone's battery excessively, so that I can rely on it throughout the day without worrying about it crashing or leaving me with a dead battery.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Syncing Issues):**

*   **As a Samsung Watch user, I want the app to sync quickly and accurately with my watch, so that I don't waste time waiting and I can trust the data I see in the app.**

**Option 3 (Focus Combining Issues - Most Comprehensive):**

*   **As a Samsung Watch user who relies on this app, I need it to be stable (not crashing), not drain my battery, and reliably sync accurate data with my watch quickly; so that I can effectively use the app and my watch without frustration and wasted time.**

**Option 4 (Breaking it down into smaller stories):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to be more stable and to stop crashing so I can use it without constant interruptions.**
*   **As a user, I want the app to consume less battery power so it doesn't drain my phone so quickly.**
*   **As a Samsung Watch user, I want the app to sync with my watch quickly and efficiently so I don't have to wait so long.**
*   **As a Samsung Watch user, I want the app to sync data accurately with my watch so the data on my watch and in the app match.**

**Explanation of Elements in a Good User Story:**

*   **As a [WHO]:** Defines the user type.  In this case, it's a user (specifically a Samsung Watch user in some options).
*   **I want [WHAT]:** Describes the desired functionality or outcome.  This is where we capture the core problem from the review.
*   **So that [WHY]:** Explains the motivation or value for the user.  This helps the developers understand why the feature is important.

**Why these are good examples:**

*   **User-centric:** They are written from the perspective of the user, using ""I want...""
*   **Clear:** They clearly state the problem the user is facing.
*   **Valuable:** They explain the benefit the user will receive by having the problem solved.
*   **Testable:** While not explicitly stating *how* to test, the user stories provide a clear goal that can be validated.  (e.g., ""Data on watch and in app match can be tested against real-world data"").
*   **Address all problems:** Each story covers all the problems cited by the user

When choosing the right option, consider:

*   Which story best captures the **most important** problem from the user's perspective.
*   Whether there are **multiple, distinct problems** for which separate stories would be clearer. This approach would allow for feature improvements or fixes to be made independent of each other.
*   How the story will be used in the development process (e.g., for prioritization, estimation, and testing).

"It's good but the Bluetooth connection with the band keeps falling and you have to go to the app to reconnect , and the band itself counts steps if you just move it in your hand !!",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are two user stories based on the user review, broken down for clarity:

**User Story 1: Bluetooth Connection Issues**

*   **As a user,** I want a stable and reliable Bluetooth connection between my fitness band and my phone.
*   **So that,** I don't have to constantly manually reconnect the band through the app when the connection drops unexpectedly.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The Bluetooth connection should remain stable for at least [specify a reasonable timeframe, e.g., 8 hours] of normal use (e.g., walking, sitting, sleeping).
    *   The app should automatically attempt to reconnect to the band if the connection is temporarily lost due to brief signal interference, without requiring user intervention.

**User Story 2: Inaccurate Step Counting**

*   **As a user,** I want the fitness band to accurately track my steps based on actual movement.
*   **So that,** I can get a reliable estimate of my daily activity level and progress towards my fitness goals.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The band should not register steps unless I am actively walking or engaging in a similar step-based activity.
    *   The band should not significantly increase the step count when I am stationary but moving my arm or hand. (Define ""significant"" numerically if possible, e.g., less than 5 steps per minute when the arm is moving but the body is not moving)

**Why two user stories?**

I've split this into two user stories because they represent separate problems and likely require different solutions.  A single, overly broad user story would be difficult to test and address effectively.

"Still 1star, sleep app is/I'm understanding it now, but my Honor band 5, is miss reading the step count, out by 133steps, I found out yesterday. Can you fix it PLEASE???",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's the user review converted into a user story, from the user's perspective:

**As a user with an Honor Band 5, I want the sleep app to accurately track my step count so that I can have a more reliable record of my activity levels and better understand my overall health.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The step count recorded by the sleep app should closely match the step count displayed on my Honor Band 5.
*   The difference in step count between the app and the band should be minimal (ideally less than 10 steps).
*   The fix should be implemented quickly to minimize the ongoing inaccuracy in my step count data.

I work a 12 hr shift and i walk 10 of those hours.  This doesn't count all of my steps. Not happy about the way it shows your rewards. Won't let you see each reward. Before update was better. Not excited about using this anymore.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories converted from the review, broken down for clarity:

**User Story 1 (Problem: Inaccurate Step Tracking)**

*   **As a user who works a long shift with a lot of walking,**
*   **I want the app to accurately track all of my steps, even during my extended walking periods,**
*   **So that I can get a complete and accurate representation of my daily activity.**

**User Story 2 (Problem: Poor Reward System Presentation)**

*   **As a user motivated by rewards,**
*   **I want to be able to easily see a detailed list of all available rewards,**
*   **So that I can understand what I am working towards and feel more engaged with the app.**

**User Story 3 (Problem: Regression After Update)**

*   **As a long-time user of the app,**
*   **I want updates to improve the app's functionality and user experience,**
*   **So that i will continue to be a happy and active member of the User Community.**

These stories capture the key issues from the user's perspective and provide a clearer understanding of their frustrations. They allow the development team to focus on addressing these specific problems and improving the user experience.

"Come on Garmin, haven't been able to sync with my watch for more than a week now. Tried to unpair, and now I can't even pair the watch again... Any updates coming to fix this soon?",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story converted from the user review:

**As a Garmin watch user, I want my watch to sync reliably with my Garmin Connect app, so that I can track my activities and view my fitness data without frustration.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The watch should sync successfully with the Garmin Connect app regularly.
*   If I need to unpair and repair my watch, the pairing process should complete successfully.
*   I should be able to receive timely updates and information about potential syncing issues and their resolutions.

**Reasoning:**

The user is frustrated because they can't sync their watch, breaking the core functionality of tracking and viewing their data. The inability to re-pair makes the situation worse. The user wants a stable syncing experience and clear communication regarding potential issues. This user story captures those desires from the user's point of view.

"The app quit tracking activities as of the first of October.  I was happy with the app until now, even though you can't customize it more.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few versions of user stories derived from the user review, each emphasizing slightly different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on the lost functionality):**

*   **As a** loyal user of the activity tracker app,
*   **I want** the app to track my activities accurately as it always has,
*   **So that** I can continue to monitor my progress and achieve my goals.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** The app accurately tracks my activities from October 1st onwards, without interruption.

**Option 2 (Focus on the negative impact):**

*   **As an** activity tracker user who was previously satisfied with the app,
*   **I want** the app to resume tracking my activities,
*   **So that** I don't lose my activity data and can continue trusting the app for reliable tracking.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** The app provides accurate and continuous activity data after October 1st.

**Option 3 (Adding the customization element as context):**

*   **As an** activity tracker user who would like more customization options but valued the core functionality,
*   **I want** the app to consistently track my activities without interruption,
*   **So that** I retain that core trusted functionality and can get the full insight into my progress.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** The app resumes tracking activity from October 1st and continues to accurately record activity data.

**Explanation of the choices:**

*   Each story follows the Agile format: ""As a [user role], I want [feature], so that [benefit].""
*   They all address the central problem: the app stopped tracking activities.
*   Option 3 highlights the customization issue without making it a primary feature, providing context for the developers. This could be beneficial for understanding the user's overall satisfaction and potential areas for future improvement.

HELP HELP PLEASE HELP ME. ..I been trying to set up this app on my phone for 2 days now .and it keeps saying invalid email and I can't download this app on my home computer. ..,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Okay, here's the user review converted into a user story:

**As a user, I want to be able to successfully create an account and start using the app on my phone within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., immediately), because I am currently unable to do so due to a persistent ""invalid email"" error and cannot download the app on my computer as an alternative.**

Here's a breakdown of why this works:

*   **""As a user""**:  Clearly identifies who the story is about.
*   **""I want to be able to successfully create an account and start using the app""**:  Specifies the desired outcome - the user wants to use the app. Adding ""start using the app"" broadens the requirement as account creation is just one step.
*   **""on my phone within a reasonable timeframe""**:  Sets a reasonable expectation (immediately is ideal), as the user has been actively trying to use the app for two days. Also specifies that the user wants to use the app on their, most likely preferable, method.
*   **""because I am currently unable to do so due to a persistent 'invalid email' error and cannot download the app on my computer as an alternative""**: Explains the user's current problem and its impact. This adds crucial context for the developers to understand the urgency and specific issue. This adds that the inability to resolve the issue through their computer is important to the users inability to resolve the problem.

This user story captures the essence of the user's frustration and provides a clear goal for development.

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **As a...:** Defines the user (Garmin Forerunner 35 user on Android).
*   **I want...:** States the desire/goal (to be able to connect device).
*   **So that...:** Explains the reason/benefit (to sync running data).

Choose the option that best fits your team's preferred level of detail in user stories! It might also be helpful to add acceptance criteria to the user story to make it even more clear when the story is complete. For example:

**Acceptance Criteria (for any of the above):**

*   The user can select Garmin Forerunner 35 from a list of supported devices within the app.
*   The app successfully connects to the user's Garmin Forerunner 35 via Bluetooth.
*   Running data from the user's Garmin Forerunner 35 syncs to the app.

"Every morning, my location access indicator is on. Lo and behold, Garmin Connect keeps it active all the time. If I kill the app it goes away, but that also kills smart unlock. I can't comprehend how this app can be referred to with a straight face.",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories based on the user review, focusing on different problems the user is experiencing:

**Option 1 (Focus on Privacy/Location Tracking):**

*   **As a user, I want Garmin Connect to only access my location when I am actively using features that require it, so I can be confident my privacy is respected and my battery isn't unnecessarily drained.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Smart Unlock):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to use Smart Unlock features without Garmin Connect constantly accessing my location in the background, so I can balance convenience with privacy and battery life.**

**Option 3 (Focus on the frustration with the app in general):**

*   **As a user, I want Garmin Connect to be battery-efficient and respect my privacy by only accessing my location when absolutely necessary, so I don't feel frustrated and suspicious of the app's behavior.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   All options are written from the user's perspective (""As a user..."").
*   They each capture a key problem highlighted in the review:
    *   The first option directly addresses the always-on location access.
    *   The second option highlights the conflict between location access and smart unlock.
    *   The third option addresses the overall feeling of frustration and a lack of trust in the app.
*   They all state a desired outcome (""so that..."").

The best option to use depends on which problem you want to prioritize addressing first. The first two are most directly related to the technical issues described in the review.

Be nice if it stored data online somewhere or had an option to export data or transfer it from one phone to another. Otherwise this app does exactly what it is supposed to do with my watch. The watch's sleep-tracking has always been super impressive to me.,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few versions of the user story, focusing on slightly different aspects of the user's request:

**Version 1 (Focus on Data Backup/Transfer):**

> As a user, I want the app to store my sleep data online or allow me to export it, so I can back up my data, transfer it to a new phone, or access it from other devices without losing my sleep tracking information from my impressive watch.

**Version 2 (Focus on Avoiding Data Loss):**

> As a user with impressive sleep tracking data from my watch, I want the app to either store my data online or provide a way to export/ transfer it to another phone, so I don't lose my valuable sleep history if I switch devices or the app malfunctions.

**Version 3 (More concise):**

> As a user, I want the option to back up or transfer my sleep data (from my impressive watch tracking) to avoid data loss if I change phones or the app has issues.

**Key elements in all versions:**

*   **""As a User...""**:  Starts the user story from the user's perspective.
*   **Identifying the User's Need**:  Clearly  states the desire for data backup, export, or transfer.
*   **Justification**: Explains *why* the user needs this - to avoid data loss, switch devices, etc.
*   **Context**: Briefly mentions the impressive sleep-tracking capabilities of the watch, providing context for the user's desire to preserve the data.

The best version for you will depend on the specific needs of your team and the context of the project. All of them capture the essence of the user's requirement.

"There should be an auto pause function for outdoor cycle mode. I have to manually pause every time I stop and more often than not, I forget to press resume and the app is not recording my progress",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few variations of user stories based on your input, each with slightly different levels of detail, focusing on the user's perspective:

**Option 1 (Simple & Concise):**

*   **As a cyclist using the outdoor cycle mode, I want the app to automatically pause when I stop moving, so I don't lose tracking progress due to forgetting to manually pause.**

**Option 2 (More Detail):**

*   **As an outdoor cyclist, I want the app to automatically pause my workout recording when it detects I've stopped moving, so I don't accidentally continue recording inaccurate data or lose progress by forgetting to manually pause and resume.**

**Option 3 (Focus on the Problem):**

*   **As an outdoor cyclist, I'm frustrated that I have to manually pause the app every time I stop, and I often forget to resume, resulting in incomplete workout recordings. Therefore, I want an auto-pause feature that activates when I stop moving, so my workout data is accurate and complete.**

**Key improvements in the Story:**

*   **User-Centric:** The story starts with ""As a..."" defining the user role or persona.
*   **Goal-Oriented:** It states what the user *wants* to achieve (e.g., accurate and complete workout data).
*   **Benefit-Oriented:** It explains *why* the user wants this feature (e.g., to avoid inaccurate data, to ensure complete recordings).
*   **Addresses the Problem:** It clearly acknowledges the pain point (forgetting to manually pause affecting recorded progress).

My wife and I have the same band yet her app shows the details of her exercise such as performance while mine remains blank. Is this an issue with my band or just a difference in software on our phones.?,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories based on the user review, focusing on different aspects and levels of detail:

**Option 1 (Focus on the core issue):**

> As a user with a fitness tracker, I want my app to accurately display my workout data, just like my wife's app does for her tracker, so I can track my progress and stay motivated.

**Option 2 (More Specific and actionable):**

> As a fitness tracker user, I want the app to show the same workout details (like performance data) that my wife's app shows for her identical fitness tracker, so I can ensure my tracker is working correctly and I'm not missing important data.  I also want to understand if the problem lies with my tracker or the app.

**Option 3 (Includes frustration and understanding):**

> As a user who recently purchased a fitness tracker, when I pair it with the app on my phone, I expect to see my workout data displayed in a similar way to how my wife's app displays data from her identical tracker.  If my app remains blank while hers shows data, I need to understand if the problem is with my fitness tracker, the app software on my phone, or a configuration issue, so I can resolve it quickly and track my fitness effectively.

**Breakdown of how the user story elements are extracted:**

*   **""As a user...""**:  Identifies the user persona (fitness tracker user).
*   **""I want...""**:  States the user's goal or desire (accurate workout data, same display as wife's app, understanding the cause).
*   **""So that...""**: Explains the benefit or reason for the goal (track progress, ensure correct functioning, resolve the issue, track effectively).

The best option will depend on the level of detail needed for your specific project. Option 2 or 3 probably provide the best starting point for developers to investigate as they highlight the ""why"" and also indicate the user's expectation for parity between identical devices.

the only thing I have a problem with is the that the food caloric measurements arent accurate. I added in and item that was on the list and it didnt add in the protein counts.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a couple of options for user stories based on the user review, focusing on slightly different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on Calorie Accuracy):**

*   **As a user who is tracking my caloric intake, I want the food calorie measurements in the app to be accurate, so that I can reliably monitor my diet and reach my health goals.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Nutritional Information Accuracy):**

*   **As a user who is tracking my macros with this app, I want all nutritional information (calories, protein, fats, carbs) to be completely accurate when I add food items, so I can trust the data and know I am getting the proper readings based on my food intake.**

**Option 3 (More Detailed - and potentially covering both issues):**

*   **As a user who is carefully tracking my food intake with this app, I want both the caloric values and the macronutrient breakdowns (like protein) to be accurate for all food items, so that I can rely on the app to provide a true representation of my dietary intake and effectively reach my nutritional goals.**

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **They are from the user's perspective:** They start with ""As a user...""
*   **They state the user's goal:**  They clearly articulate what the user is trying to achieve (tracking their diet accurately).
*   **They explain the benefit:** They explain *why* the user wants this feature (to monitor their diet, reach health goals, trust the data).
*   **They are concise:** They get straight to the point.
*   **They are actionable:** They give the development team a clear understanding of what needs to be addressed.

Choose the version of the user story that best reflects the overall intent and scope of the user's feedback. If the core issue is simply calorie counting, Option 1 is sufficient. If the user is concerned about the accuracy of *all* nutritional data, including protein, Option 2 or Option 3 would be more appropriate.  Option 3 is the most complete, encompassing both issues identified in the source material.

"Awful. Today my watch shows 8800 steps. The Health app shows 6500. Combining the data doesn't work. To make matters worse the old app, that just showed the watch, is no longer working. Ugh.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user story options based on that review, varying slightly in focus:

**Option 1 (Focus on Data Inconsistency):**

*   **As a fitness-conscious user, I want my watch and the Health app to display the same step count, so I can trust the accuracy of my activity tracking data and have a consistent view of my progress.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Aggregation and Reliability):**

*   **As a user who relies on aggregated fitness data, I want the app to reliably combine data from my watch and other sources into a single, accurate view in the Health app, so I don't have to manually reconcile conflicting information and can get a complete picture of my activity.**

*   **""I want...""**:  States the user's desire or goal. This is the core of the story.
*   **""So that...""**:  Explains why the user wants this.  It provides the business value or benefit.  This helps the developers understand the *motivation* behind the need.

**How each option addresses the review:**

*   **All Options:** Address the core problem of inconsistent step counts.
*   **Option 2 & 3:** Specifically address the data aggregation issue.
*   **Option 3:** Acknowledges the app transition issue, implicitly covering the loss of functionality from the old app.

**Which option to choose?**

The best option depends on the overall priorities of the development team and the product owner.
* If the most pressing concern is the data inconsistency, **Option 1** is a good choice.
* If the data aggregation is the core functional need, **Option 2** is ideal.
* If the update and migration process is a priority, **Option 3** is best.

I am not able to use the Watch face store as it is not available.. when will hawei provide this feature in India.. kindly update this feature in India.. a smart watch gets useless because of limited watch faces..,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few user stories based on your review, prioritized from most impactful to least (as the review itself has embedded importance):

**User Story 1 (Highest Priority - Addresses core pain):**

*   **As a Huawei smartwatch user in India, I want to have access to a watch face store so that I can customize my watch face and avoid feeling limited by the available options, which currently makes my smartwatch feel less useful.**

*   **Focus on Value:** Each story clearly articulates the benefit the user will receive. In this case, it's about customization, avoiding limitations, and making the smartwatch more useful.
*   **Context:** The location (India) is crucial and included in each story, as the review specifically calls this out.
*   **Choice Considerations** 
    *   A User Story focuses on the need, rather than the exact solution.
    *   The ""so that"" portion is arguably the most important because that part of the user story explains the benefit and business value of completing that task.

I've only been able to get it to sync twice with my Samsung Tab 4.  Sent message to Support and they answered with a million questions that I had no idea what they were talking about and it took them 2 weeks to send me that!  Pretty useless app!,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few options for converting that user review into a user story, ranging from broad to more specific:

**Option 1 (Broadest):**

*   **As a user, I want my app to reliably sync with my Samsung Tab 4, so that I can use it without frustration.**

    *   This captures the core need: reliability.

**Option 2 (More specific, focuses on the pain points):**

*   **As a user with a Samsung Tab 4, I want the app to reliably and consistently synchronize with my device, so that I don't experience sync failures.**
*   **As a user, I want helpful and timely support when I encounter problems with the app, so that I can quickly resolve issues and continue using it effectively.**

*This highlights both the syncing problem and the poor support experience.*

**Option 3 (Most Specific, breaking down the problems further):**

*   **As a user with a Samsung Tab 4, I want the app to sync consistently without any configuration changes, so that I can access my data without having to repeatedly troubleshoot sync issues.**
*   **As a user seeking support, I want to receive clear, concise, and relevant information from support staff in a timely manner (within 24-48 hours maximum), so that I can quickly resolve my problem and get back to using the app.**

*This breaks down the ""unhelpful support"" into specific issues like clarity, relevance and timeliness.*

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **""As a user...""**:  This framing is fundamental to user stories, putting you in the user's shoes.

*   **""I want...""**:  This expresses the user's *desire* or *goal*.

*   **""So that...""**:  This explains the *benefit* or *reason* behind the user's desire.  It's important for understanding the *why* behind the feature.

*   **Specificity**:  The more specific you are, the better the development team can understand the problem and create a solution. However, too much detail can limit their creativity in finding the *best* solution.  Start broader and break it down if necessary.

*   **Focus on the Problem**: The user story focuses on the *problem* the user is facing, not a specific solution. That's the development team's job to figure out.

*   **""Samsung Tab 4""**:  This is important context!  The problem appears to be related to a specific device.

**Which User Story to Use?**

The best choice depends on the context of your project and the level of detail the development team needs.

*   If you're just starting out, **Option 1** (Broad) is a good place to start.
*   As you gather more information about the problem, you can refine it into **Option 2** or **Option 3** (More Specific).
*   **Option 3** is useful if you've identified specific areas where support or syncing is failing (e.g., unclear instructions, slow response times).

Remember to discuss these user stories with your team to ensure everyone is on the same page about the user's needs.

My Marq Expedition lost connection every day and the only one way to reconnect is to make remove device and full re-pair with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ UPD: The lost connection issue was gone for a week but today i've face it again.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Alright, here are a few user stories derived from the user review, focusing on different aspects and priorities:

**Option 1 (Focus on the daily disconnect):**

*   **As a Marq Expedition user with a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, I want my watch to maintain a stable connection with my phone throughout the day, so that I don't have to constantly remove and re-pair the device to regain functionality.**

**Option 2 (Focus on the frustration of re-pairing):**

*   **As a Marq Expedition user with a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, I want to avoid the time-consuming and inconvenient process of removing and re-pairing my watch every day due to lost connection, so I can rely on my watch's notifications and features without disruption.**

**Option 3 (Focus on the intermittent nature of the problem and desire for reliability):**

*   **As a Marq Expedition user with a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, I need the connection between my watch and phone to be consistently reliable, even after periods of stability, so I can trust the watch for its intended functionality without unexpected disconnections.**

**Option 4 (Short and Sweet):**

*   **As a Marq Expedition user with a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, I want a stable and reliable connection between my watch and my phone, so I don't have to keep re-pairing.**

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **""As a... I want... so that...""**:  This is the standard user story format.
*   **Specificity**:  Each story includes the model of both watch and phone, as the problem might be specific to this combination.
*   **Focus**:  Each story emphasizes a slightly different aspect of the user's problem (daily disconnect, re-pairing process, intermittent nature).  The best one to use depends on what aspect the developers want to prioritize.
*   **Actionable**:  The stories are written in a way that allows developers to understand the problem the user is facing and what a successful resolution would look like.
*   **""UPD"" Information**: The ""UPD"" information (the issue returning after a week) is crucial. It highlights that the problem might seem fixed initially, but can reappear. This is why I included the idea of *consistent* reliability in some of the options.

When choosing the best user story, consider:

*   Which aspect of the problem is most common or severe?
*   Which resolution would provide the greatest value to the user?
* Which option the development team deems the most important to prioritize.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Prioritization:** The product owner can prioritize these user stories based on user impact, technical feasibility, and alignment with the product roadmap.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Each user story should have specific acceptance criteria that define when the story is considered complete and meets the user's needs (e.g., ""The app allows me to search for foods and log the associated calorie count"").
*   **Further Elaboration:**  The reviewer clearly likes the app. This is good to know. Maybe if possible, understand why and what they like. It may help prioritize some of these features over others.

Happy with the app but for some reason the backlight has stopped working on my vivofit device. Is this connected to the app updates or is it a hardware issue?,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the user review into a user story, depending on the emphasis you want to place:

**Option 1 (Focus on resolving the problem):**

*   **As a** Vivofit user,
*   **I want** the backlight on my device to work correctly after app updates,
*   **So that** I can easily view the screen in low-light conditions without worrying about app-related malfunctions or further device deterioration.

**Option 2 (Focus on investigation):**

*   **As a** Vivofit user,
*   **I want** to understand why my device's backlight stopped working after the recent app update,
*   **So that** I can determine if it's a software issue (related to the app) or a hardware failure needing repair, and take appropriate action.

**Option 3 (Focus on proactive communication):**

*   **As a** Vivofit user,
*   **I want** to receive clear communication about potential risks to device functionality (like the backlight) when app updates are released,
*   **So that** I can make informed decisions about installing updates and avoid unexpected device issues.

**Explanation of the elements (applied to Option 1):**

*   **As a...**: Defines *who* the user is.  This clarifies the user's role and perspective.
*   **I want...**:  Defines *what* the user desires or needs. This should be a clear statement of the goal.
*   **So that...**: Defines *why* the user wants it. This provides the benefit or value the user expects to gain.

The best option will depend on the goal of user stories being written and which aspect of the feedback is most relevant. As the user is unsure about the reason for the issue, Option 2 would probably be the most helpful.

"Doesn't allow integration to other services like Strava. I will have to return my Watch GT if I can't at the very least manually export my activities. Otherwise good app. Syncs some activities to Google Fit, but misses most of the data.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories based on the review, ranging in granularity. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

**Option 1 (High-Level):**

*   **As a fitness enthusiast, I want to seamlessly integrate my activity data with other popular fitness platforms (like Strava), so I can consolidate my fitness tracking and participate in broader fitness communities.**

**Option 2 (More Specific):**

*   **As a user of the app and a Watch GT owner, I want the ability to export my activity data (at least manually) so that I can use the data with other platforms like Strava, even if direct integration isn't available.**

**Option 3 (Focusing on the negative impact and desire for a solution):**

*   **As a user, I am frustrated that activity data from my Watch GT cannot be reliably synced to other services like Strava, or easily exported. Because of this, I will likely need to return the watch. To keep me as a customer, I need either direct integration with commonly used fitness platforms or, at a minimum, a robust manual export function.**

**Option 4 (Addressing the partial Google Fit Integration):**

*   **As a user who relies on Google Fit for a central record of my activity data, I am frustrated that the Watch GT integration only syncs *some* data and *misses most* of the workout details. I need a complete and reliable sync to Google Fit so I can have a full picture of my activity on Google Fit.**

**Key Considerations when Choosing:**

*   **Level of Detail:**  How specific does the team need the story to be?  A higher-level story allows more room for discussion and potential solutions.  A more specific story guides the development towards particular features (like a manual export function).

*   **Focus:**  Do you want to highlight the positive aspects (the ""good app"" part) or focus on the pain point that is causing the user to consider returning the product?

*   **Impact:**  The stories focusing on the return highlight the severity of the issue, making it clear that this feature is critical for user retention.

No matter which story you choose, make sure the acceptance criteria are clear and measurable. For example, if you choose option 2, the acceptance criteria might include:

*   ""I can export my activity data in a common format (e.g., GPX, TCX, CSV).""
*   ""The exported file contains all relevant data, including distance, time, pace, heart rate, and elevation.""
*   ""The export process is straightforward and easy to understand.""

Previously working but now everytime says require a new version.May be u people got corona and not able to fix this error for one month.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's a user story derived from the review, focusing on the user's perspective and need, while also acknowledging the context:

**As a user, I am frustrated that the application, which used to work, is now constantly prompting me to download a new version, so that I can continue to use the application without interruption and get the value I expect from it.**

Here's a breakdown of why this is a good user story:

*   **Focuses on the User:**  It starts with ""As a user..."" placing the emphasis on their experience.
*   **States the Need:** ""I am frustrated that... is constantly prompting me to download a new version..."" It clearly articulates the problem the user is facing.
*   **States the Goal/Benefit:** ""...so that I can continue to use the application without interruption and get the value I expect from it."" This highlights what the user *wants* to achieve by having the problem fixed.

*   **Context (Corona Reference):** While the review includes a comment about the pandemic, it's best to leave that out of the user story itself.  The pandemic is a development context, but doesn't directly impact the *user's* core need, which is simply to use the working application. You can keep the pandemic context in the ticket for the team to be aware of.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**  The user story would benefit from acceptance criteria examples:
    *   The application does not prompt me to download a new version after I have already installed the latest version.
    *   I can successfully use the application's core features without receiving an error message related to outdated versions.
*   **Priority:** Given the severity (app unusable), this would likely be a high-priority user story.
*   **Splitting:** Depending on the complexity of the application, you might consider splitting into more specific User Stories, focusing on specific features.

This conversion focuses on the core issue the user is reporting (the constant require-new-version prompt) and translates it into a usable format for development and prioritization.

Pairs first time.. then nothing. Cant find device the next day. Thought it was my vivofit so went and exchanged it... same thing this morning. Everytime you log on you have 2 start from the beginning rather then saving the connection! What a waste of money buying this device,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user stories extracted from that review, focusing on the core issues the user is facing:

**User Story 1 (Focus on the connectivity issue):**

*   **As a user,** I want my device to connect reliably every time I use it, so that I can easily track my activity without having to set it up from scratch each time.

**User Story 2 (Focus on the expectation of saved connections):**

*   **As a user,** I expect the device to automatically reconnect to my app after the initial pairing, so that I don't have to go through the pairing process again every day.

**User Story 3 (Focus on the value/frustration):**

*   **As a user,** I want my device to work consistently, so that I don't feel like I wasted my money and experience frustration with constant troubleshooting.

**Optional User Story (Focus on device discovery):**

*   **As a user,** I want my device to be easily discoverable by my phone or computer, so that I can set it up and sync data without unnecessary hassle.
Additionally you could add an acceptance criterea such as:
'Given that the device has been previously paired to my phone it should be able to auto-connect within 10 seconds of opening the app'

**Why these work:**

*   **User-Centric:**  They are framed from the perspective of the *user*.
*   **Clear Goal:**  They state *what* the user wants to achieve (the goal).
*   **Benefit:** They often imply *why* the user wants it (the benefit).
*   **Actionable:**  They can be used by developers to understand the problem and find/implement solutions.

The review highlights a major pain point around device connectivity and the expectation that a paired device should maintain that connection. The user sees it as a waste of money because the core functionality of effortless tracking is broken by this issue.

You have taken a good app that was accurate and made it terrible.  I just walked 3.5 miles and it said I had 800 steps....took my heart rate....measured by hand 120bpm....app 59....  get ur act together,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's a user story derived from that review, focusing on the user's perspective:

**As a user who relies on the app for accurate fitness tracking, I want the app to accurately track my steps and heart rate so that I can get a reliable measure of my activity levels and ensure my workout data is correct.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   When I walk 3.5 miles, the app should register a step count that aligns with that distance, and is not significantly inaccurate (e.g., a step count of 800 is unacceptable).
*   When I manually measure my heart rate at 120 bpm, the app should provide a heart rate reading that is close to that manual measurement, and is not off by a significant margin (e.g., 59 bpm is unacceptable).
*   The app should not have regressed and become significantly less accurate than it used to be in previous versions.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Focus on User Need:** I focused on the user's core need, which is accurate fitness tracking.
*   **Highlights Specific Problems:**  I made sure to allude to the specific problems mentioned in the review (inaccurate step count, inaccurate heart rate), but without making the user story overly specific to that one instance (so it can apply to future iterations).
*   **Emphasizes Reliability:** The user clearly values reliability, so I used words like ""accurately,"" ""reliable,"" and ""correct"" to capture that sentiment.
*   **Addresses Regression:** The user mentioned the app becoming worse, so I included an acceptance criteria to capture the intention of preventing regression.

*   Understanding how different workouts impact my calorie expenditure.
*   Tracking my progress effectively over time.
*   Making informed decisions about my fitness plan.

"Functions well but need to install huawei apps separately. I guess it is due to the non business ethic that Google do. Just need email, no phone number required. Huawei need to catch up auto installation from google play store.",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories extracted from the review, prioritizing clarity and focusing on different potential angles:

**Option 1 (Focus on the frustration of manual app installation):**

*   **As a user with a Huawei device, I want Huawei to automatically install commonly used apps (like email clients) from the Google Play Store, so that I don't have to manually install them separately due to potential Google restrictions, which is frustrating and time-consuming.**

**Option 2 (Focus on email specifically):**

*   **As a user of a Huawei device who primarily needs email functionality , I want a seamless way to access and use my email (without needing to manually install apps separately), so that I can easily communicate and stay connected.**

**Option 3 (Focus on the bigger picture experience):**

*   **As a user purchasing a Huawei device, I want a user experience equivalent to a device that can automatically install apps from Google play store after initial setup so that I don't have to manually install Huawei apps separately.**

**Option 4 (More technical and directly related to the user's perceived cause):**

*   **As a user caught between Google and Huawei's policies, I want Huawei to find a way to automatically install necessary apps in my device, so that I overcome the technical challenges of installing required apps due restrictions that google does.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   A user story aims to be a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user of the system.
*   I've used the standard ""As a... I want... so that..."" format.
*   The ""so that..."" clause explains the benefit to the user. This is *critical* for understanding *why* the user wants this.
*   I've avoided including the user's opinions about ""non-business ethics"".  User stories should focus on needs, not opinions. However, alluded to the reasoning for the need in some versions.
*   I've made the assumption that the user is talking about a *new* Huawei device, since the complaint is likely setup of device.
*   The different options emphasize different aspects of the user's complaint, allowing you to select the most appropriate story based on your priorities. If the goal is to reduce friction in initial setup, Option 1 or 3 is best. If the focus is making email easier, Option 2 is better."

*   **As a user familiar with the previous version of the app, I want to be able to access the ""Together"" tab in the updated app without encountering an identity verification error, even though I haven't changed my login credentials, so I can continue to use the app's social features.**

**Option 4 (Specific and action oriented):**

*   **As a user, when I use the updated app, I expect to be able to navigate to the ""Together"" tab successfully, without being stopped by a false ""it couldn't verify your identity"" error, so I can continue to engage with the community features in the app.**

**Explanation of the Choices:**

*   **Option 1** is very broad.  It captures the essence of the problem (the app isn't working right) but gives the development team little to go on specifically.
*   **Option 2** focuses more on the ""Together"" tab issue. It acknowledges the user's previous positive experience and makes it clear they want the app to work *as it used to*.
*   **Option 3** adds even more context by mentioning the user hasn't changed their credentials. This hints that the problem may be with the app's authentication process, not the user's actual identity.
*   **Option 4** is the most explicit about exactly the problem needing fixing and the expectation of navigating without an error.

**Which One to Use?**

The best option depends on the context and how granular your team likes user stories.  If you need a quick placeholder, Option 1 might suffice. If you want to give the developers a clear understanding of the issue from the user's perspective, Option 3 or 4 is probably better. You might also choose Option 2 initially and then refine it as you gather more information about the ""identity verification"" problem.

App was perfect up until the last update.. Now it will not even open with out giving a era message. I'm going to delete if its not corrected by Monday.. 4/27/2020..,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's a user story based on the review, focusing on the user's need and experience:

**As a user who relies on the app for [mention assumed purpose of the app, e.g., managing my finances, staying in touch with friends, tracking my fitness], I am frustrated that the latest update prevents the app from opening and displays an error message, so that I can no longer use the app and I will be forced to find an alternative solution if the issue is not resolved by Monday, April 27, 2020.**

**Explanation of elements & reasoning:**

*   **As a user who relies on the app for...""**:  We start with identifying the user and giving context to their use of the app.  The bracketed part `[mention assumed purpose of the app, e.g., managing my finances, staying in touch with friends, tracking my fitness]` **needs to be replaced** with an assumption based on the app's category. We don't know the app's function from the review alone.  This helps explain WHY the user is upset. If you fill in what they were trying to do with the app, it's more powerful.  Even if the context from assumed usage is not provided, the story would be useful.
*   **""...I am frustrated that the latest update prevents the app from opening and displays an error message...""**: This is the core problem -  the app is now unusable.
*   **""...so that I can no longer use the app...""**: This highlights the impact of the problem on the user.
*   **""...I will be forced to find an alternative solution if the issue is not resolved by Monday, April 27, 2020.""**:  This expresses the urgency and the user's threat to abandon the app.  This is important because it shows *how important it is to the user* to have the issue resolved, adding extra weight to the problem.
    For example, if the issue is not resolved, the user will switch to competitor ABC.

This user story helps the development team understand the problem from the user's perspective and prioritize fixing it within the specified timeframe. It also emphasizes the impact of the bug on the user's overall experience.

"I like the food tracking feature and other options, although some feel gimmicky. One negative: Samsung glossed over the fact that some meals have more than one gram of sodium; input is capped at 999.9 mg.

**As a health-conscious user who utilizes the food tracking feature, I want to be able to accurately track my sodium intake above one gram (1000mg) so that I can properly monitor my diet and make informed food choices.**

**Why:**

*   **Addresses the pain point:** The user can't accurately track sodium intake beyond 999.9mg, which is a limitation given that some meals have more than that amount.
*   **Highlights the benefit:** Enables more accurate diet monitoring and informed decision-making, further supporting their health goals.
*   **Maintains the user's perspective:** It's phrased from the user's point of view (""As a... I want... so that..."")

Very helpful app from a personal point of view. At times does crash on me. Wish they would post your total km achieved in the month?,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories based on the user review, broken down to prioritize different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on Core Functionality & Stability):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to be stable and not crash, so that I can reliably track my progress and use it without frustration.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Feature Request - Monthly Distance Tracking):**

*   **As a user, I want to see a summary of my total kilometers achieved each month, so that I can easily track my monthly progress and set goals.**

**Option 3 (More comprehensive, covering all points):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to be stable and reliable so that I can trust it to accurately track my progress.**
*   **As a user, I want a summary view displaying my total distance (in kilometers) for the current month, so that I can easily monitor my progress against my monthly goals.**

**Why these options?**

*   **""As a user"":**  Ensures the story is written from the user's point of view.
*   **""I want"":**  Expresses the user's desire or need.
*   **""So that"":** Explains the reason or benefit for the user.

**Choosing the Best Option:**

The best option depends on the current development focus.  If stability is a major issue, focus on Option 1. If adding new features is the priority, Option 2 is better. Option 3 is good if you want stories addressing each element.  They can even be broken down into individual tasks beneath a larger epic.

"Used to have no problems syncing with my Samsung Note5, as it worked fine for 2 months, and then stopped syncing.  There were connection problems prior to the absolute complete failure to sync. Now very sad.",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few options for user stories, ranging from more simple to more detailed, based on the user review ""Used to have no problems syncing with my Samsung Note5, as it worked fine for 2 months, and then stopped syncing. There were connection problems prior to the absolute complete failure to sync. Now very sad.""

**Option 1 (Simple):**

*   **As a user, I want my Samsung Note5 to reliably sync with the app, so I can keep my data up-to-date and avoid frustration.**

**Option 2 (More Specific, focuses on the failure):**

*   **As a user with a Samsung Note5, I want the app to maintain a stable and consistent connection for syncing, so that it doesn't suddenly stop working after a period of time like it did when it stopped working after 2 months of working fine.**

**Option 3 (Includes the connection problems):**

*   **As a user with a Samsung Note5, I want a smooth and reliable syncing experience, so that the app doesn't exhibit connection issues leading up to a complete sync failure.**

**Option 4 (Includes the negative feeling):**

*   **As a user with a Samsung Note5, I want the app to reliably sync my data without connection problems, so I don't experience frustration and disappointment when it stops working.**

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Focus:** Each option focuses on the core problem: the syncing stopped working.
*   **""As a...I want...so that..."" format:** This is the standard user story format.
*   **Specificity:** The more specific options include details about the intermittent issues and the user's device. This can be helpful for developers in diagnosing the problem.
*   **Emotional Impact:** Option 4 includes the ""sad"" element. While not always necessary, highlighting user frustration can underscore the importance of fixing the issue.

**Which option to choose?**

The best option depends on your team's needs. If you need a quick, high-level overview, option 1 is fine. If you need more detail to guide development and testing, choose option 2, 3, or 4.  I would lean towards option 3 or 4 as it captures the pre-failure connection issues which provides valuable context for the development team.

**As a frustrated user of the app, I want the app to stop falsely detecting my phone as rooted and displaying frequent error messages, so that I can use my phone (and potentially the app) without constant interruptions.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The app no longer incorrectly identifies my phone as rooted.
*   The app does not display error messages related to root access when I am not actively using the app.
*   If the app needs to prevent rooted users from using the app, it should only display the error message once when I first download it or attempt to start the app, not continuously.

"overall, the app gives me all the data I need. but lately, I have been experiencing hanging and crashing upon opening. please resolve this issue. thanks now, it can not record my activity if I am not connected to the internet..",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user story options based on the user review, ordered from most specific to more general, depending on how you want to prioritize the issues:

**Option 1 (Prioritizes Crashing/Hanging):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to open reliably without crashing or hanging, so I can access my data and use the app's features.

**Option 2 (Addresses both Crashing and Offline Functionality):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to open and function properly, even when offline, so I can reliably record my activity and access my data regardless of my internet connection.

**Option 3 (Most General - Captures Both Issues):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to perform reliably and be usable offline, so I can track and access my data anytime, anywhere.

**Explanation of Choices and Rationale:**

*   **""As a user""**: Starts the story with the user perspective.
*   **""I want...""**: Defines the user's desired outcome.
*   **""...so I can...""**: Explains the reason or benefit for wanting the feature/fix.

**Why these options work:**

*   They directly address the user's pain points: crashing/hanging and the inability to record activity offline.
*   They are concise and easy to understand.
*   They set the stage for developers to understand the ""why"" behind the request and explore the underlying causes.

**Considerations:**

*   **Prioritization:** If the crashing/hanging is a critical issue impacting many users, **Option 1** is best. The offline issue can be addressed in a separate story.
*   **Scope:** If you want to address both issues at once and they are related (e.g., offline functionality triggers the crashes), **Option 2** or **Option 3** are more appropriate.
*   **Technical Details:** The user stories do not include technical details or solutions. This is intentional because the purpose is to define the problem from the user's perspective. The development team will then investigate and determine the best technical solution.

Choose the user story that best reflects your priorities and the scope of work you intend to address. Remember that a well-defined user story is a crucial starting point for successful software development.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Option 1** is concise and focuses on the most disruptive issue: the app freezing.  It's good for prioritizing the fix.
*   **Option 2** directly addresses both the freezing issue and the feature request in separate stories.
*   **Option 3** is the most detailed.  It includes the ""when...I want...so that..."" format, making the context and desired outcome very clear.  This is helpful for developers.

The best user story will depend on the development team's preferences and level of detail needed for effective task management. **Choose the level of detail that best suits your purposes.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   All options maintain the user's perspective.
*   All options include the role (Runner or Garmin User) and the goal.
*   The ""So that"" clause explains the benefit to the user explicitly.
*   Option 2 is the most specific, highlighting the exact devices in use. This is important because the review implies this specific device combination isn't working.
*   Option 3 explicitly includes the user's expectation and frustration (""...as I expect a new device to work correctly""), which can be important in setting the tone for development.

The best option depends on the specific context and what information the development team needs to prioritize. Since the user specifically mentions device incompatibility, **Option 2** is likely the most actionable and helpful.

"Best graphic display I've seen out of all the fitness apps, just lacking the option of seeing the detailed stats of your friends on the apps even if your friends wanted to allow you. I think you can't see stats either via website.",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories based on your provided user review, focusing on different granularities and priorities:

**Option 1 (Focus on the missing feature):**

*   **As a user who enjoys staying motivated and competitive with friends, I want to be able to see detailed workout statistics of my friends (if they choose to share them with me), so that I can better understand their progress and compare it to my own.**

**Option 2 (Broader scope, including the website):**

**Key considerations for choosing the right user story:**

*   **Level of detail:**  Are you looking for a high-level story or something more specific that can be directly translated into a development task?
*   **Scope:**  Does the need span multiple platforms (app and website)?
*   **User motivation:** What is the core reason behind the user's request?  Is it competition, support, curiosity, etc.?

Choose the user story that best fits your project's goals and development approach.  I recommend prioritizing the most specific and impactful need.

Cannot disable heart monitor. Before i had difficulty switching the continuous heart rate monitor on. Now it does not allow me to disable it... When will the saga end...,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few options for converting that user review into a user story, capturing slightly different nuances and levels of detail. Choose the one that best fits your team's style and project needs:

**Option 1 (Simple and Direct):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to easily disable the continuous heart rate monitoring feature, so that I can conserve battery life and control my privacy.**

**Option 2 (More Specific and Emotionally Aware):**

*   **As a user who has had past issues with the heart rate monitor, I want a clear and reliable way to turn off the continuous heart rate monitoring, so I don't feel frustrated and out of control with the device's functionality.**

**Option 3 (Focus on the Problem/Pain Point):**

*   **As a user, I am frustrated that I am unable to turn off the continuous heart rate monitoring feature, and I want a clear and easy way to disable it, so I can avoid unnecessary battery drain and maintain control over my data.**

**Explanation of Choices and Key Elements:**

*   **""As a user...""**:  This clearly establishes the perspective from which the story is being told.
*   **""...I want...""**:  This identifies the desired functionality or capability.
*   **""...so that...""**: This explains the *reason* or *benefit* behind the desire.  This is crucial for understanding the user's motivation and making informed design decisions.

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **User-Centric:** They are written from the user's point of view.
*   **Goal-Oriented:** They focus on what the user wants to achieve.
*   **Value-Driven:** They explain why the user wants the feature (the benefit).
*   **Testable:**  They provide a basis for acceptance criteria (e.g., ""The user can turn off the continuous heart rate monitor in under 5 seconds."").

**Further Considerations When Implementing:**

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**  Define specific criteria that must be met for the story to be considered ""done.""  For example:
    *   ""The user can disable continuous heart rate monitoring through a clear and easily accessible setting.""
    *   ""Disabling continuous heart rate monitoring stops the device from constantly recording heart rate data.""
    *   ""The user receives confirmation that continuous heart rate monitoring has been disabled.""
*   **Severity/Priority:**  Given the phrasing (""When will the saga end...""), this suggests a high level of user frustration, indicating a high priority to fix.
*   **Investigation:** The developers will need to investigate *why* the user is unable to disable the feature. Is it a bug? Is the UI confusing? Is the setting hidden?

By using one of these user stories and adding appropriate acceptance criteria, you can effectively address the user's feedback and improve the overall user experience. Remember to communicate the implemented solution back to the user, so they know the development team has resolved their issue.

"I really like this app, however I track carbs not calories and wish I had an option to have this be my main tracker for my food. I would give this a 5 star otherwise.",Samsung Health,feature_request,"**As a user who tracks carbohydrates, I want to have the option to make carbohydrates my main, customizable tracker within the app, so that I can easily and efficiently track my carb intake instead of calories.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The app allows the user to select ""Carbohydrates"" as their primary tracking focus.
*   When carbohydrates are the primary focus, the main display and data entry elements prioritize displaying carbohydrate information.
*   The app still tracks other nutritional information (e.g., calories) in the background but emphasizes carbohydrate data.

**Benefit:** This feature will allow users who focus on carbohydrate tracking (like the reviewer) to have a more tailored and efficient user experience, potentially increasing user satisfaction and retention (as evidenced by the reviewer wanting to award a 5-star rating if this feature existed).

*   **As a user,**
*   **I want to receive accurate and reliable weather notifications on my watch,**
*   **So that I am informed about current and upcoming weather conditions without having to check my phone.**

*   **Clear value:** Each story clearly states what the user wants to achieve and why it's important to them.
*   **Independent:**  The stories are independent of each other, meaning they can be addressed and implemented separately.
*   **Negotiable:** The way ""all available watch faces"" are defined or when ""accurate and reliable"" weather notifications are achieved is something that can be discussed and agreed upon.
*   **Testable:**  You can easily create acceptance criteria for each story. For example, ""Users outside of China can see and download watch faces available to users inside China"" or ""Weather notifications are displayed on the watch and are within X degrees/percentage of the actual weather conditions as reported by a reliable weather service."""

*   **""I want to be able to share my fitness data with Fitbit""**: This is the specific goal or desire expressed in the original review (""would love to be able to share to Fitbit too""). It's action-oriented.
*   **""so that I can have all my health and fitness information in one place""**:  This is the *benefit* or *reason why* the user wants this feature. It highlights the value they're seeking.
*   **""even though I can already share my progress with other apps and track sleep, water, and caffeine intake.""**: This provides context. It highlights what's *already working* well, and gives the developers a clearer understanding of the user's current experience and expectations. It also ensures the developers don't accidentally break existing functionality.

So Bad app I can't receive notification well and can't download apps on my watch and the app closes in the background so useless app,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's a user story derived from the review, focusing on the user's perspective:

**As a watch user, I want reliable notifications and the ability to download apps on my watch, so I can stay informed and utilize its full functionality without frustration.**

**Alternatively, you could break it down into smaller stories:**

*   **As a watch user, I want to receive reliable notifications, so I don't miss important information like messages or alerts.**
*   **As a watch user, I want to be able to download apps directly to my watch, so I can expand its capabilities without needing my phone.**
*   **As a watch user, I want the app to run reliably in the background, so I can be confident it is always ready when I need it.**

**Explanation of why these are good user stories:**

*   **Focuses on the ""Who,"" ""What,"" and ""Why"":** Clearly states *who* (a watch user) wants *what* (reliable notifications, app downloads) and *why* (to stay informed and utilize functionality).
*   **User-Centric:** It's told from the user's point of view, making it easier for developers to understand the user's needs.
*   **Actionable:**  Provides a clear goal for the development team to address.
*   **Testable:**  Allows for clear acceptance criteria (e.g., ""Notifications are received within X seconds of being sent,"" ""User can successfully download an app from the watch app store"").

*   **So that** I can continue to grow my network and engage with more individuals.

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** I can successfully connect to new people in the app, even after having connected with over 5500 users.  The connection process should not result in an error.

**Option 2 (Focus on the Problem):**

*   **As a** user who has already connected with a significant number of people (over 5500),
*   **I want to** be able to connect with additional individuals without encountering errors,
*   **So that** I can continue using the app as intended and expand my network.

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The app allows me to connect to new individuals without displaying an error message, even after connecting with over 5500 people.

**Option 3 (More Detailed):**

*   **As a** user,
*   **I want to** connect with new people after already connecting with approximately 5500 other users,
*   **So that** I can expand my network and utilize the app's full functionality.

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   I can initiate a connection request with new users.
        *   The connection request is successfully sent and received by the other user.
        *   The app does not display an error message when I attempt to connect with new users after having connected with approximately 5500 others.

**Why these are good:**

*   **""As a, I want, So that"" format:**  This adheres to the standard user story format.
*   **User-centric:**  The story is written from the user's perspective.
*   **Clear and concise:**  Easy to understand.
*   **Focus on the user's goal:**  Highlights what the user is trying to achieve.
*   **Addresses the specific problem:**  Pinpoints the connection error.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Provides clear guidelines for developers to address the issue and confirm the fix.

The best option will depend on the specific context and priorities of your team. However, each of these captures the essence of the user review and translates it into a useful user story. The acceptance criteria is especially important to ensure that the problem is truly fixed.

**As a user, I want to be able to access the Huawei Health app on my phone, so that I can track and manage my health data.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   I should be able to open and use the Huawei Health app without being prompted to install the Huawei App Gallery.
*   If the Huawei App Gallery is required, I should be able to find it easily in the Google Play Store (or another appropriate app store for my device) and install it.
*   After installing the necessary components, I should be able to successfully access and use the Huawei Health app.

**Problem Statement:**

A user is unable to access the Huawei Health app because it prompts them to install Huawei App Gallery, which they cannot find in the Play Store. They are therefore unable to use the health app at all.

You must be add the feature for find the band in the Huawei health app to find the band via application ... And theam in the band's back ground... Thanks I hope you will consider my things in the next updates...,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting the user review into user stories, each with a slightly different focus:

**Option 1 (Combining both requests into one story):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to find my Huawei Band through the Huawei Health app and customize the band's background theme, so that I can easily locate my band if I misplace it and personalize my wearable experience.**

**Option 2 (Breaking it into two separate stories):**

*   **Story 1: Find My Band**
    *   As a user, I want a ""Find My Band"" feature in the Huawei Health app, so that I can easily locate my band if I misplace it around my home or office.

*   **Story 2: Customizable Band Backgrounds**
    *   As a user, I want to be able to change the background theme of my Huawei Band, so that I can personalize the look of my wearable.

**Explanation of the choices:**

*   **""As a user...""**: Adheres to the standard user story format.
*   **""I want...""**:  Clearly states the user's desired functionality.
*   **""so that...""**: Explains the reason or benefit the user expects from the feature.

**Why Option 2 might be better:**

*   **Manageability:** Breaking down the requests into separate stories allows the development team to work on them independently.  One might be easier to implement than the other.
*   **Prioritization:** It's possible the product owner might prioritize one feature over the other. Having separate stories makes prioritization easier.
*   **Testing:**  Separate features are also easier to test and validate.

I recommend discussing both options with the development team and product owner to determine which best fits their workflow and priorities.

Very good application. Everything is alright except navigating back to main page/my day page. Also finding some settings i.e. recording smart/par min is difficult. Make setting simple . It will be awesome.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few user story options extracted from the review, focusing on the user's perspective:

**Option 1 (Focus on Navigation):**

*   **As a user, I want to easily navigate back to the main page or my day page from anywhere in the application, so that I can quickly return to my primary task or overview.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Settings):**

*   **As a user, I want to easily find and understand settings such as recording smart/par min, so that I can customize the application to my preferences without frustration.**

**Option 3 (Combined, encompassing both issues):**

*   **As a user, I want straightforward navigation and easily accessible settings, so that I can quickly get back to the main display or to easily set features like recording and par.**

**Explanation of the choices:**

*   **""...I want...""**: This states the user's desire or need.
*   **""...so that...""**: This explains the benefit or reason behind the desire.

**Which story is best?**

It depends on your team's priorities.

*   If navigation is the biggest pain point for users (based on other feedback or data), **Option 1** might be prioritized.

*   If settings accessibility is the bigger issue, **Option 2** might be prioritized.

*   **Option 3** is a good way to capture both issues, but it might be beneficial to break it into separate stories to ensure that they get addressed.

"I bought this thinking i could use this for open water swimming. Far from efficient, as i couldnt close the app after i finished. Would have been great to have been able to tell the actual water temp too. Also the sleep function is ineffective.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user story options based on that review, covering different levels of granularity and focus:

**Option 1 (Focus on Open Water Swimming & Closing the App):**

*   **As an open water swimmer, I want to be able to reliably close the app after my swim, so I don't waste battery and can easily use my phone for other tasks.**

*   **As an open water swimmer, I want the app to display the water temperature, so that I can adequately prepare for my swim.**
*   **As someone tracking my sleep, I want the sleep function to accurately record my sleep, so I can get reliable data on my sleep patterns.**

**Option 3 (Combined and More Detailed, but Still Focused on Specific Points):**

*   **As an open water swimmer and health tracker user, I want the following features to work effectively:**
    *   **Ability to properly close the app after an open water swim session, so my battery isn't drained unnecessarily.**
    *   **The app to display the water temperature during my swim, so I can accurately record and prepare for my open water swim.**
    *   **Accurate sleep tracking, so that I can confidently use the app to monitor and improve my sleep habits.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As an [Actor]"", ""I want [Goal]"", ""so that [Benefit]""**:  This is the standard format for user stories.
*   I've tried to capture the user's pain points directly:
    *   Inability to close the app is a clear frustration.
    * The ability to see the water temperature would enhance the app's usefulness for open water swimming.
    * Ineffective sleep tracking leads to unreliable data.
*   The level of detail can be adjusted depending on how granular your team prefers user stories.  Option 1 is the most concise. Option 3 breaks it down into even more detail.

Choose the option that best fits your team's development process and the level of detail required for your backlog. You might even choose to break down Option 3 into three separate, smaller stories for easier tracking and implementation.

"As of version 4.42 I can no longer sync activities from my Garmin 810 to my Samsung galaxy android via Bluetooth. Up until April 28, 2021 it was working ok",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the user review into a user story, each with a slightly different focus. Choose the one that best aligns with your team's priorities:

**Option 1: Focusing on Functionality (most common)**

*   **As a** Garmin 810 user
*   **I want** to be able to sync my activity data from my Garmin 810 to my Samsung Galaxy Android device via Bluetooth
*   **So that** I can track my fitness progress and analyze my workout data on my mobile device.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Bluetooth connection is established successfully between the Garmin 810 and Samsung Galaxy Android device.
*   Activity data is transferred accurately and completely from the Garmin 810 to the app on the Android device.
*   Regression: Be sure that the functionality that was working correctly before April 28, 2021 is still working, or that a fix is implemented to resolve the issue.

**Option 2: Focusing on the Regression & Time Sensitivity**

*   **As a** user who previously had a working Garmin 810 - Samsung Galaxy sync
*   **I want** the ability to sync my activity data from my Garmin 810 to my Samsung Galaxy Android device via Bluetooth restored to the state it was on April 28, 2021
*   **So that** I can continue my previous workflow (without any disruption) of analyzing my workout data on my mobile device.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* Verify that the syncing functionality is working after the fix that was working correctly before April 28, 2021.
* Bluetooth connection is established successfully between the Garmin 810 and Samsung Galaxy Android device.
* Activity data is transferred accurately and completely from the Garmin 810 to the app on the Android device.

**Option 3: More General (but less helpful)**

*   **As a** Garmin 810 user on Android
*   **I want** reliable Bluetooth connectivity
*   **So that** I can use all features of the app.

**Discussion of options**

*Include information about the Android OS version, as software updates on the android phone could be the cause of the issue*

**Key Considerations for all Options:**

*   **Prioritization:** This user story should likely be high priority, as it's a regression issue (something that used to work and now doesn't).
*   **Investigation:** The development team will need to investigate what changed in version 4.42 to cause this issue. They may need to gather more information from the user, such as:
    *   Specific Android version
    *   Garmin Connect app version
    *   Steps to reproduce the issue
    *   Error messages (if any)
*   **Testing:** Thorough testing will be needed after the fix to ensure the issue is resolved and no other Bluetooth-related functionality is broken.
*   **Regression Testing**: Regression testing of the fix should be performed against multiple device/OS combinations to ensure that the fix will not break existing working functionality.

This app is so hard to sign in. It just a watch app. Not a bank app. If i can i want to give this app 0 star. Please fix it. I dont want to buy any watch from huawei. It so annoying.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's a user story based on the review, focusing on the core need and frustration:

**As a Huawei Watch user, I want to be able to easily and quickly sign in to the watch app, so that I can use the app's features without the annoyance of a complicated and frustrating login process.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The sign-in process should be simple and straightforward.
*   The number of steps required for sign-in should be minimal.
*   The sign-in process should be significantly easier than it is currently.

**Reason/Value:**

*   Avoid frustration and annoyance with the app.
*   Encourage continued use of the app.
*   Improve the overall user experience, possibly preventing the user from switching brands.

**Further Considerations (Based on the Review):**

*   **Simplicity is Key:** The user emphasizes this is *just* a watch app, implying the sign-in process should be appropriate for the app's complexity and not overly demanding like a banking app.
*   **Potential Brand Impact:** The strong negative sentiment suggests that a continued negative experience could drive the user away from Huawei products entirely.  Addressing this is important for customer retention.

"Was liking till update now all my info won't sync, and sync with the calorie counter had never worked hoping uninstall reinstall helps if not may be returning",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story converted from the review:

**As a user, I want my data to sync properly after an update, especially with the calorie counter, so I can continue tracking my progress without interruption.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   After updating the app, my existing data should still be accessible and synchronized.
*   My data should consistently and automatically sync with the calorie counter feature.
*   If uninstalling and reinstalling does not resolve syncing issues, I will consider returning the product.

**Explanation of the mapping:**

*   **""Was liking till update now all my info won't sync...""** translates to the user wanting their data to sync *after* an update.
*   **""...and sync with the calorie counter had never worked...""**  explicitly states a desire for the calorie counter sync to function.
*   **""...hoping uninstall reinstall helps if not may be returning""** implies that if the issues cannot be resolved, the user will potentially return the product. This indicates a high degree of importance in the resolution.

You cannot enter your weight manually....only thru a high tech Huawei weigth monitor...$$$ plus where do you buy that??? Not in Mexico....so very useless app,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few variations of a user story based on that review, focusing on different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on the core usability issue):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to manually enter my weight into the app, so that I can track my weight even if I don't have a compatible Huawei weight scale.**

    *   This version gets straight to the problem: the mandatory hardware dependency.

**Option 2 (More emphasis on the frustration):**

*   **As a user, I am frustrated because I cannot manually enter my weight into the app, forcing me to buy a specific (and potentially unavailable in my region) Huawei weight scale, making the app almost useless to me.**

    *   This version captures the emotional impact and highlights the frustration of the user.

**Option 3 (Focus on the negative impact to the user):**

*   **As a user, I need the ability to manually enter my weight because I cannot purchase the Huawei weight scale in Mexico, which makes the app nearly useless for tracking my weight and fitness goals.**

    *   This version frames the issue as an obstacle to the user achieving their goals.

**Option 4 (Includes the cost aspect):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to manually input my weight, because requiring the expensive and hard-to-find Huawei weight scale to input my weight means that the app is essentially unusable for me.**

    *   This directly addresses the cost barrier and the frustration of not being able to use a paid-for app.

**Explanation of elements:**

*   **As a user:** This clearly defines the perspective.
*   **I want/need/am frustrated/etc.:**  This describes the user's desire, need, or feeling.
*   **So that/because/etc.:**  This explains the reason or motivation behind the desire/need/feeling.
*   The story highlight the problem and what the user wants to do about it.

I would recommend that you choose the version that best highlights the aspect of the issue that is most important for your team to address. All of these stories reveal a significant usability problem. Good luck!

Can't link my watchfit as it doesnt appear in device list even after updates. Worse thing is asking for random permissions -camera location call before letting a person use the fitness band. Why is it even necessary to link the fitness band with the phone to start with? Deeply disappointed,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's the user story based on the review, broken down into multiple stories for clarity:

**Story 1: Device Connection**

*   **As a user,** I want to be able to easily connect my WatchFit fitness band to the app, so that I can track my fitness data.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   My WatchFit device is visible in the device list within the app.
    *   The connection process is straightforward and doesn't require excessive troubleshooting.
    *   The app is up-to-date.

**Story 2: Permission Requests**

*   **As a user,** I want to understand why the app requires certain permissions (like camera, location, call), so that I can make an informed decision about granting them.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The app provides a clear and concise explanation for each permission it requests.
    *   The explanation details how the permission will be used and why it is necessary for app functionality.

**Story 3: Functionality without Connection**

*   **As a user,** I want to be able to use basic functionalities of my fitness band (e.g., step tracking, time display) even without initially connecting it to the app, so that I can start using the device immediately.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Some initial or basic features of the fitness band work without mandatory linking to the phone app.

**Reasoning behind Breaking it Down:**

*   **Clarity:** Separating the issues makes each problem more distinct and actionable for developers.
*   **Prioritization:** The team can prioritize fixing the connection issue and then address the permission request problem separately.
*   **Scope:** Each user story has a clearly defined scope and achievable acceptance criteria.

"Before the update was the best app,  i don't have every day steps counting and nothing that i have interes.  if you don't is fix it , im gone uninstall the app",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few variations of user stories derived from the user's review, focusing on different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on the Missing Feature):**

*   **As a user who previously enjoyed daily step counting, I want to have my daily steps automatically tracked again like before the recent update, so that I can continue to monitor my activity levels and stay motivated.**

**Option 2 (Focus on the General Issue):**

*   **As a loyal user, I want the app to provide me with features that I find engaging and relevant, like it did before the recent update, so that I can continue to find value in the app and not be forced to uninstall it.**

**Option 3 (More Direct and Emphasizing Urgency):**

*   **As a frustrated user, I need all the features I previously used and enjoyed to be restored immediately, particularly daily step counting, so that I can continue using the app and avoid uninstalling it.**

**Why these are User Stories:**

*   **""As a...""**:  Identifies the user role.
*   **""I want..."" / ""I need...""**:  States the user's desire or need.
*   **""So that...""**: Explains the reason or benefit of the desired feature/fix.

**Key Considerations When Choosing a User Story:**

*   **Which aspect of the complaint is most important to address?** The specific missing feature (step counting) or the general decline in engaging features?
*   **How quickly can the issue be addressed?**  The urgency in the user's feedback might warrant a more direct/urgent story.
*   **Development team's needs:** Choose the story that best helps the development team understand the *impact* of the problem on the user.

I hope this helps!

"Hi, my app was working grate until I upgraded my cell phone now I can't get the app to sync, I tried uninstalling and adding it again but that didn't work.  It's showing on my phone as a connected device but it's not syncing.",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few variations of user stories based on that review, ranging from a more general one to more specific ones:

**Option 1: General User Story**

*   **As a user who has recently upgraded my phone, I want my app to seamlessly sync my data so that I can continue using it without interruption.**

**Option 2: More Detailed User Story**

*   **As a user who has upgraded my phone, I want the app to automatically recognize the new device and begin syncing my data, even after uninstalling and reinstalling the app, so that I don't lose access to my information.**

**Option 3: Problem-Focused User Story**

*   **As a user, I am frustrated that after upgrading my phone, my app shows as a connected device but is not syncing my data, even after reinstalling. I want the app to sync correctly so that I can access the most up-to-date information after a device upgrade.**
The best option depends on the level of detail needed. the more detailed story is better because it clearly shows what the desired outcome is.

When should the more detailed option be used?

*   **When the team needs a very clear understanding of the problem and the desired solution.**  If the team needs to see the specific steps the user already tried (uninstall/reinstall) or the exact symptom (shows as connected but isn't syncing), this is the better option. This is good when the issue is subtle and the context is important.
*   **To guide testing and QA efforts.** Having the specific context in the user story allows testers to focus directly on the scenario described.
*   **To facilitate a more detailed conversation within the team.** The extra details can spark discussion about the root cause of the issue and potential solutions.

**As a privacy-conscious user, I want to be able to use the app without granting it permissions that allow it to make phone calls, change system settings, or perform other actions that give it excessive control over my phone, so that I can trust the app will not compromise my privacy or security.**

Can you allow offline connection with the App and please have a feature (like other health fitness watches) that screen lights up (and vibrates) when notification is received.,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories derived from the user review, focusing on different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on Offline Access):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to access basic functionality of the app even when I don't have an internet connection, so that I can still track my progress and view historical data when I'm in areas with poor or no service.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Notifications):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to activate my device screen and vibrate when I receive a notification, so that I don't miss important updates or messages while I'm exercising or otherwise engaged.**

**Option 3 (Combines Both):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to work offline for basic functions AND provide on-screen, vibrating notifications, so that I can always monitor my fitness and stay informed, regardless of my internet connection.**

**Option 4 (Most Specific, might guide development better):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to view my workout history and daily step count while offline, and I want my fitness tracker's screen to light up and vibrate with notifications (e.g. texts, calls, achievement alerts) when connected to the app, so I don't miss anything even when I can't hear my phone.**

**Why these options work as User Stories:**

*   **They are ""user-centered"":** They are written from the perspective of *who* wants *what* and *why*.
*   **They are concise:** They're short and to the point, easily understood.
*   **They are actionable:** Developers can use these to guide their work: ""Okay, let's make sure the workout history is cached locally and can be displayed offline.""  ""Let's implement the notification triggering for device screens and vibrations.""
*   **They provide value:**  The ""so that..."" part highlights the user's goal and motivation.

The best option will depend on the specific needs and priorities of the development team and the product roadmap.  Option 4 is generally the most useful as it provides the most clarity regarding the specific features. Remember to elaborate further on each User Story with specific acceptance criteria.

Limited compatibility ito connectivity with Samsung Health Google Fit and Discovery Health app. HR monitoring not shared with Google Fit limiting usefulness of Huawei. Also not syncing with Discovery app. Update: does now sync but at its own scheduled times.,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few user stories based on the provided review, with varying levels of detail and focus:

**Option 1 (Focus on Basic Goal):**

*   **As a user, I want my Huawei device to seamlessly sync my heart rate data with Google Fit, Samsung Health, and the Discovery Health app so that I can track my fitness progress in the platforms I already use.**

**Option 2 (More Specific, Reflecting Current State):**

*   **As a user who uses Google Fit, Samsung Health, and the Discovery Health app, I am frustrated that my Huawei device has limited compatibility and only syncs with them at scheduled times, because this limits the usefulness of my Huawei device for tracking my fitness progress.**

**Option 3 (Most Detailed, Capturing the Evolution):**

*   **As a user who relies on Google Fit, Samsung Health, and the Discovery Health app, I was initially disappointed that my Huawei device did not automatically sync all my data (especially heart rate) with these platforms, limiting its overall usefulness.**
*   **As a user, I am now able to sync my Huawei device with Discovery Health, but I am still frustrated that it only syncs at a schedule decided by Huawei, rather than in real-time or on-demand, reducing its convenience.**
*   **As a user who values accurate heart rate data, I am disappointed that heart rate monitoring is not reliably shared with Google Fit.**

**Explanation of Choices and Important Considerations:**

*   **Persona:**  All stories assume the user is someone who actively tracks their health and fitness and relies on established platforms like Google Fit and Discovery Health.
*   **Focus:** Each story emphasizes a slightly different aspect:
    *   Option 1 is the simplest, focusing on the core desire for seamless integration.
    *   Option 2 adds the element of frustration and the scheduled syncing issue.
    *   Option 3 breaks down the experience into distinct phases: initial disappointment, partial resolution, and remaining frustrations.  This is useful if the development team wants to address each issue individually.
*   **""So that..."" (Benefit):**  (Some of the options include the implicit ""so that I can"" part of the user story in their outcome ""track my fitness progress"".) This helps to clarify the motivation behind the requirement.
*   **Priority:** Depending on the product strategy, the development team might prioritize the automatic/real-time syncing or the unreliable heart rate data.

**Why User Stories Matter:**

These user stories help the development team understand:

*   **WHO** is using the product (a health/fitness-conscious individual).
*   **WHAT** they want to achieve (seamless data integration).
*   **WHY** it's important (convenient tracking of progress in preferred platforms).

By framing the issues as user stories, the team can focus on solving real user problems and improving the overall user experience of the Huawei device.  They also help guide the development team in creating acceptance criteria to verify they are solving the user's problems.

My activities from My Fitness Pal don't sync into the Connect app. I'm having to enter my workouts manually.  My information such as my picture or personal stats/settings are saving some and not others. My screens look nothing like any of the screenshots or videos.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user review converted into user stories, focusing on individual actionable points:

**Story 1: Activity Syncing**

*   **As a** user who uses MyFitnessPal to track my workouts and activities,

*   Each story has a clear ""so that"" goal, helping developers understand the user's motivation.
*   It allows for more granular tracking of development progress.  You can address the syncing issue separately from the profile issue, and so on.

This approach is more helpful for the development team.

Used to be pretty useful! Unfortunately it appears the dev team has removed the standalone oximeter function for a reason that escapes my reasoning. As a pilot I used to use it for my high-altitude flying.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few ways to convert that user review into a user story, keeping the user's perspective and incorporating the relevant details.

**Option 3 (Focus on Explanation and Justification):**

*   **As a pilot flying at high altitude who relied on the standalone oximeter function, I want to understand why it was removed so I can either find a suitable alternative within the app or adjust my workflow accordingly.** (This includes a need for communication from the developers).

**Why these are good User Stories:**

*   **""As a...""** Clearly identifies the user persona (pilot).
*   **""I want...""** Expresses the user's desire or need.

I work a 12 hr shift and i walk 10 of those hours.  This doesn't count all of my steps. Not happy about the way it shows your rewards. Won't let you see each reward. Before update was better. Not excited about using this anymore.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories derived from the user review, focusing on different aspects of the user's concerns:

**Option 1 (Focus on steps and activity tracking):**

**Explanation of the Choices:**

*   **Each story follows the ""As a [user role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"" format.**
*   I have broken down the review into key areas of concern: inaccurate step tracking and a clunky/inferior rewards system. I have also included a rollback from what this person perceives as a beneficial experience to a now frustrating one.

**Key considerations when choosing a user story:**

*   **Product Owner:**  The most appropriate user story will depend on what the Product Owner prioritizes. Is the core function of step tracking more important to fix first, or addressing the rewards dissatisfaction?
*   **Development Team:** The development team will need enough information to convert the story into actionable tasks.

I hope this helps!

"I use the app on my galaxy active 2 watch to track my exercises, however, it's missing Barre and HIIT. I have to use ""other"" workout to track. Can you please add Barre and/or HIIT (high intensity interval training) to the exercise list?",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories derived from the review, each focusing on a slightly different aspect:

**Option 1 (Focus on the need for specific workout types):**

*   **As a Galaxy Active 2 watch user, I want to be able to track Barre and HIIT (high intensity interval training) workouts directly within the app, so that I no longer have to use the generic ""other"" workout option and get more accurate data.**

**Option 2 (Focus on improving tracking capabilities):**

*   **As a user who tracks my exercises using the app on my Galaxy Active 2 watch, I want the app to include Barre and HIIT workout options in the exercise list, so that I can have a more specific and insightful record of my fitness activities.**

**Option 3 (More Direct):**

*   **As a Galaxy Active 2 watch user, I want Barre and HIIT to be added to the exercise list, so that I can accurately track these specific workouts.**

**Key Considerations When Choosing:**

*   **Specificity:** How specific do you want to be about the reason for the request (e.g., inaccurate data, generic tracking)?
*   **Emphasis:** Do you want to emphasize the benefit of specific workout tracking or the ease of use?

Regardless of the option you choose, they all capture the user's perspective and directly address the problem outlined in the review.

The **first option** is generally the best because it is the most contextually descriptive and provides the most information, emphasizing the pain of using the ""other"" option and the benefit of accurate data.

It is basic.. But doesn't remind for logging foods or starting an activity. Also should give weight loss tips and advice for each day..like noom coach,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a few different user stories we can create from that review, broken down by focus:

**Option 1: Focus on Reminders (Most Obvious Complaint)**

*   **As a busy user, I want to receive reminders to log my meals and start activities, so I can stay consistent with my weight loss plan even when I'm occupied.**

**Option 4: Breaking Down the Review into Separate User Stories**

*   **As a user, I want to receive reminders to log my foods, so I can accurately track my calorie intake.**
*   **As a user, I want to receive reminders to start activities, so I can increase my physical activity levels consistently.**
*   **As a user, I want to receive weight loss tips and advice for each day, like a Noom coach, so I can learn healthy habits and make progress toward my weight loss goals.**

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **From the User's Perspective:** Each story starts with ""As a user...""
*   **Clearly Defined Goal:** Each story specifies *what* the user wants.
*   **Reasoning:** Each story specifies *why* the user wants it (the benefit they receive).
*   **Concise:** The stories are relatively short and easy to understand.
*   **Actionable:** The development team can use these stories to understand the user's needs and prioritize features.

The best user story to use depends on the specific context and which aspect of the user's feedback the development team wants to prioritize. If reminders are the easiest to implement and quickly improve the user experience, Option 1 is a good starting point. If providing coaching is the core value proposition, Option 2 is better. If you want to address everything, Option 4 breaks it down nicely.

"This app is now pretty worthless since Samsung dropped the weight tracker (weekly, monthly), as well as the food (calories) and caffeine trackers. Not a smart move by Samsung.",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few options for user stories based on that review, focusing on different aspects and levels of detail:

**Option 1 (Focus on Impact):**

*   **As a health-conscious user who relies on tracking my progress, I want the app to include weekly and monthly weight tracking, as well as food and caffeine tracking, so that I can effectively monitor my health and reach my goals.**

**Option 2 (Focus on specific features):**

*   **As a loyal user of the Samsung Health app, I want to be able to track my weight data on a weekly and monthly basis so that I can visualize my progress over time.**

*   **As someone who wants to be mindful of my caloric intake, I want the app to have a food tracker so that I can log my meals and monitor my calorie consumption.**

*   **As a person who likes to track their caffeine consumption, I want the app to have a caffeine tracker so that I can monitor my caffeine intake and make sure I'm staying within healthy limits.**

**Option 3 (Focus on frustration):**

*   **As a user who previously found this app valuable, I am now frustrated by the removal of the weekly/monthly weight tracker, food tracker, and caffeine tracker, because the app is no longer useful for me to track my health.**

**Why these work:**

*   **""As a...""**: Establishes the user persona.
*   **""I want...""**: States the user's need or desire.
*   **""So that...""**: Explains the benefit or reason behind the need.
*   They clearly reflect the user's negative experience and point out the missing features.

**Which option is best depends on your specific needs.**  If you need a single story that encompasses all the issues, Option 1 is probably best but it could also be divided into multiple stories.

I love the watch and now record information from the watch in another app in order to better track my overall performance,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few user stories derived from that user review, broken down into smaller, more focused stories:

**User Story 1 (Addressing Manual Entry):**

*   **As a user who experiences occasional syncing issues, I want the ability to manually enter data, so that I can ensure my activity information is always accurately recorded and available even when syncing fails.**

**User Story 2 (Addressing Custom Reporting):**

*   **As a data-driven user, I want the ability to create custom reports using my activity data, so that I can gain deeper insights into my performance and trends beyond the standard reports.**

**Optional User Story 3 (Addressing the Current Workaround - could be a ""nice to have"" depending on priorities):**

*   **As a user who is currently exporting data and using another app for analysis, I want the custom reporting feature that satisfies my advanced metrics and analysis requirements, so that I can streamline my fitness tracking workflow and reduce the need for external tools.**

**Explanation of Choices**

*   **Focus:** Each story focuses on a specific need or pain point mentioned in the review.
*   **""As a...I want...so that..."" Structure:**  This traditional construction helps ensure the story is user-centric and clearly defines the goal and value.
*   **Context:** The stories try to capture the implied context from the review, such as the user loving the watch but needing more control over data.
*   **Prioritization:** User Story 1 (Manual Entry) is likely the highest priority because it addresses a data loss scenario due to syncing issues. User Story 2 (Custom Reporting) addresses a desire to improve data analysis.
* User Story 3 just helps prioritize User Story 2

*   Breaking the issues into seperate stories enables more focus for development.

**Which option is best depends on how the development team wants to prioritize the work.**  Option 3 covers both issues in one story, while Options 1 and 2 separate them. Splitting it further into option 4 aids in more targeted actions. It's also possible the development team will create an additional story for the broad request of ""kindly do an update.""

I love the app but id love to see an update with some added features like more tips with stress management and more fun badges,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting the user review ""I love the app but id love to see an update with some added features like more tips with stress management and more fun badges"" into a user story, each with slightly different emphasis:

**Option 1 (Focus on Stress Management):**

*   **As a** user who enjoys using the app,

*   **""I want...""**:  States what the user desires.
*   **""So that...""**: Explains the user's motivation and the benefit they will receive.

**Choosing the best option:**

The best option depends on the specific goals of the project and the desired granularity.  If stress management is a major focus, Option 1 might be best. If they want more gamification, Option 2 is a clear choice. If it makes sense to have only one user story that encomposses both requests then option 3 might be best, depending on how the requets will be implemented.

**User Story 1 (Combined Step Counts):**

*   **As a** Galaxy Watch Active user with a Pixel 3,
*   **I want** the Galaxy Wearable app to differentiate between steps counted by my phone and steps counted by my watch,

Failing to update the device list despite my strong internet connection. And this is not even a new bug. It still keep coming up whenever I install this app again to my phone. Utterly useless Huawei!,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few variations of user stories based on the user review, each emphasizing a slightly different aspect:

**Option 1 (Focus on the core problem):**

*   **As a user of Huawei devices,** I want the app to reliably update my device list when I have a strong internet connection, so that I can be confident I'm managing all my devices.

It was good until the update now the miles tracked are off. For example I set the miles to 2.6 for biking and i completed 2.8 via google maps and it still said i had 1.63 miles to go.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's a user story based on that review:

**As a user, I want the app to accurately track my distance so that I can rely on it to track my fitness progress and accurately log my workouts.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   When I manually set a target distance for my bike ride (e.g., 2.6 miles), the app should accurately reflect the distance I've traveled.
*   If I bike a distance (confirmed by another reliable source like Google Maps) that exceeds or matches my set target, the app should recognize that I have completed the stated distance in my set target.
*   Mileage should not be off by more than .1 of a mile off of reality (e.g. Google Maps)
*   The app should accurately calculate and display the remaining distance of my targeted workout.
*   The accuracy of distance tracking should remain consistent even after app updates.

**Why this story is important:** The review clearly highlights a core expectation: accurate distance tracking. If the app isn't reliable in this area, users will lose trust and confidence in its ability to help them achieve their fitness goals. The user story focuses on the impact from the end user's point of view.

    *   Clicking the ""Verify"" button should successfully verify my identity.
    *   I should be logged into my account after successful verification.

**Why (Benefit):**

Without a working 2FA verification process, I am locked out of my account, which prevents me from accessing the app and its features.

"Old, rubbish and unusable. This app doesn't work with new devices and to download a version that does, you need to install via Huawei's App Gallery, which is really poor. Huawei hold customers to ransome - download their appstore or your device won't work!",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's the user review converted into a user story:

**As a user with a new device, I want to be able to use this app without needing to install the Huawei App Gallery, so that I can enjoy the app's features seamlessly and without being forced into using an app store I don't prefer.**

Doesn't always record the correct number of steps. For me averages 1/2 what was actually done. Have to uninstall and re install to get it correct for a little while.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story based on the review, broken down into its key components:

**As a user, I want to be confident that my step count is accurate, so that I can reliably track my fitness progress and achieve my goals.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Accuracy:** Consistently records a close to accurate number of steps I take.
*   **Reliability:** The step count should remain accurate over time without requiring me to take any corrective action.
*   **No Workaround Needed:** I should not have to uninstall and reinstall the app to restore correct step counting functionality.

**Why:** The user wants accurate step counts for reliable fitness tracking.

This story highlights the core issue (inaccurate step counting) and clearly states the user's desired outcome (reliable tracking of fitness progress) and what the user experiences now that prevents it (uninstalling and reinstalling to attempt to fix it).

"Was working mostly well before the app started asking to install a new version of Huawei mobile services. Why do I need to install another app to run Huawei health when it was working fine before. Additionally, Huawei health needs proper integration with my fitness pal and Google fit",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Okay, here are a few user stories based on the user review, breaking it down into different needs:

**User Story 1:  Avoiding Unnecessary App Installations**

*   **As a** Huawei Health user,
*   **I want to** use the app without being prompted to install additional apps like the new version of Huawei Mobile Services,
*   **So that** I can avoid unnecessary downloads and potential compatibility issues and continue using the health app as it was working before.

**User Story 2: Seamless Background Functionality**

*   **As a** Huawei Health user,
*   **I want to** easily track my health and movement
*   **So that** I can continue working out and having the app run, without interuptions or being asked to install new things

**User Story 3: Fitness App Integration - MyFitnessPal**

*   **As a** Huawei Health user,
*   **I want to** seamlessly integrate Huawei Health with MyFitnessPal,
*   **So that** I can easily track my calories and nutrition alongside my activity data in one place.

**User Story 4: Fitness App Integration - Google Fit**

*   **As a** Huawei Health user,
*   **I want to** seamlessly integrate Huawei Health with Google Fit,
*   **So that** I can consolidate all my fitness data across different platforms and have a comprehensive view of my health.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Focus on the ""Why"":**  User stories emphasize the *reason* behind the user's action.  Why do they want these things?  To avoid interruptions, to track their food and exercise together, etc.
*   **Specificity:** While Google Fit and MyFitnessPal integration is mentioned, I separated them into two stories. This allows the development team to prioritize and address them independently.
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Important Next Step):** Each of these user stories would need further refinement with *acceptance criteria*.  For example, for the Google Fit integration:
    *   *Given* I have a Google Fit account, *When* I connect Huawei Health to Google Fit, *Then* all my activity data (steps, distance, workouts) should sync automatically to Google Fit.
*   **Prioritization:** The team needs to prioritize these stories based on user impact and development effort. The ""Unnecessary App Installations"" story might be the most urgent, as it's causing immediate disruption. The integration stories might be longer-term goals.

These user stories capture the essence of the user's feedback and provide a framework for the development team to address their concerns.  Remember to add specific acceptance criteria to these stories to ensure that the implemented solution meets the user's needs.

Typical garmin. Great hardware and rubbish software. Never connects. Always shows 'mobile connection required' unless app is actually running. Horrible interface. Full of junk you don't want and stuff you do is painful to access.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few variations of user stories based on the review, with slightly different focuses.

**Option 1 (Focus on Accessibility & Connectivity):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to reliably connect my Garmin device to my mobile phone so that I can access my data and use connected features without constantly having to manually launch and keep the app running.**
*   **As a user, I want the Garmin app to easily connect to my device in the background, without constantly requiring me to have the app open, so that I can seamlessly access my data and use connected features.**

**Option 2 (Focus on User Experience & Bloat):**

*   **As a user, I want a streamlined and intuitive interface in the Garmin app, so that I can quickly find and use the features I need without being overwhelmed by unnecessary and unwanted options.**
*   **As a user, I want the Garmin app to be free of bloatware and focused on essential features, so I am able to find what I need with ease.**

**Key considerations when choosing the best user story:**

*   **Which problem is the biggest pain point for the user?**
*   **Which problem is the most common complaint about the hardware/software combination?**
*   **Which problem is the easiest to address in the short/long term?**

Before it would keep saying the application had stopped multiple times everyday when I was not using it. Now all I have is a green screen with the man running on it. Its not working.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story conversion, breaking it down step-by-step:

**Understanding the User's Intent:**

The user is experiencing two major problems:

1.  **Previous Issue:** The application was repeatedly crashing even when not in use.
2.  **Current Issue:**  The application is now stuck on a green screen with a running man graphic, indicating it's completely unresponsive.

**User Story:**

**As a [User]**
**I want [the application to work properly]**
**So that [I can successfully use the application without errors or complete failure].**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Given** I launch the application, **Then** it should not crash repeatedly when I am not actively using it.  (Addresses the previous problem of random crashes)
*   **Given** I launch the application, **Then** I should not be stuck on a green screen with a running man animation. (Addresses the current green screen issue)
*   **Given** I launch the application, **Then** I can navigate and use all expected features. (This is a more general acceptance criteria to ensure basic functionality)

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a [User]""**:  The user role is ""User,"" which is typical for a general problem report.
*   **""I want [the application to work properly]""**: This directly reflects the user's desire for a functional app. A more specific action would lose the weight of their frustration concerning the app not working.
*   **""So that [I can successfully use the application without errors or complete failure]""**: This highlights the desired outcome – a reliably functional application.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: This section makes it measurable for the development team to confirm the issues have been resolved. A test to see if a green screen shows up is a good check, as well as not crashing when not in use.

This user story captures the core issues described in the review and provides actionable information for developers to address the problems.

"After recent update, steps since 5th October 2020 no longer save (keeps resetting to zero next day). Also, steps no longer sync with Myfitnesspal app.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user stories based on that review, focusing on different aspects and levels of detail.

**Option 1 (Concise):**

*   **As a user, I want my steps to be accurately tracked and saved from October 5th, 2020 onwards, so that I can monitor my activity levels and progress over time.**

**Option 2 (More Detailed, Focusing on Data Loss):**

*   **As a user who has been tracking my steps with historical data, I am frustrated that steps recorded since October 5th, 2020, are not being saved and reset to zero each day, because I am losing valuable information about my past activity and cannot accurately track my fitness progress.**

**Option 3 (Focusing on MyFitnessPal Integration):**

*   **As a user who uses both this app and MyFitnessPal, I want my steps to sync correctly between the two apps, so that I have a complete view of my daily activity and can accurately calculate my calorie intake and expenditure.**

**Option 4 (Comprehensive, Covering Both Issues):**

*   **As a user who relies on this app to track my steps and integrates with MyFitnessPal, I am frustrated that since the recent update:**
    *   **My steps recorded since October 5th, 2020, are not being saved correctly and reset daily, resulting in data loss.**
    *   **My steps are no longer syncing with MyFitnessPal, limiting my ability to track my overall fitness progress.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a user...""**: This is the standard starting point for a user story, emphasizing the user's perspective.
*   **""...I want...""**: This expresses the user's desire or goal.
*   **""...so that...""**: This explains the benefit or value the user gets from the feature or bug fix.

**Which Option to Choose?**

The best option depends on the level of detail your team needs for planning and development.

*   **Concise (Option 1):** Good for a quick overview or as a high-level epic.
*   **More Detailed (Option 2, 3):** Useful for focusing on a specific area of concern, such as data loss or integration issues.
*   **Comprehensive (Option 4):**  Captures both issues in a single story, but might be better broken down into two separate stories for easier management.

I would recommend breaking up the review into two separate user stories for clarity and easier management in a development context. Alternatively, a single user story (like Option 4) can be used as an Epic and the two issues broken down into smaller User Stories that fall under that Epic.

**Option 3 (Focus on what the user wants to achieve):**

*   **As a user, I want to access and customize my watch with all available watch faces, so that I get the most out of my device.**
*   **As a user, I want to receive accurate weather notifications on my watch, so that I can be prepared for the day's weather conditions.**

*   **""As a user...""** -  Starts with the standard user story format.
*   **Concise and Clear:** Focuses on the core problem.
*   **Clear Goal/Motivation:** Clearly states WHY the user wants something.  This is important for developers to understand *why* they're building the feature.
*   **Actionable:**  Gives the development team something concrete to investigate (new watch faces, weather notifications).
*   **Includes Disappointment:** Reflects the user's overall sentiment.
*   **Decomposed:** If you want to use Option 3, creating the two user stories allows you and the development team to prioritize features.

I can't find any helpful advice anywhere and this seems to have occurred after the update. This is very disappointing. I just logged a workout and can't get my stats!! Get this fixed!!,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few options for user stories based on the user review, ranging from more general to very specific:

**Option 1 (General):**

*   **As a user,** I want to be able to access workout statistics and helpful advice after logging a workout, so I can track my progress and improve my fitness plan.

**Option 2 (More Specific, Focusing on Breakage):**

*   **As a user,** I want to see my workout stats after logging a workout, even after the recent update, so I can continue to track my progress and understand my performance.
*   **As a user,** after logging a workout, I expect to have access to helpful advice and data on a recent workout.

**Option 3 (Specific, Adding the 'Why'):**

*   **As a user,** I want to be able to immediately view my workout stats after logging a workout because I rely on analyzing this data to track my progress and optimize my training. Since the update, this is unavailable, rendering the platform useless.

**Explanation of Choices and Important Considerations:**

*   **Focus on User Need:**  Each story focuses on *why* the user is concerned (tracking progress, optimizing training) and *what problem they are experiencing* (can't access stats and advice).
*   **Avoid Technical Jargon:** User stories are meant to be understood by everyone, not just developers.  Avoid technical details unless they are essential to the user's need.
*   **Prioritization:** The more specific stories (Option 3) are easier to prioritize.  The strong language from the review (""rendering the platform useless"") makes it clear this is a high-priority issue to fix.
*   **""After the update"" is important Context:** Including ""even after the recent update"" or similar phrasing tells the developers that the problem is likely related to the update.  This helps them narrow down the cause.
*   **Consider Acceptance Criteria:** When a developer starts working on the user story, they will need to know *how* to determine when the Story is considered done. Possible Criteria for Option 3:

    *   When I log a workout, the stats screen is displayed immediately after login.
    *   That I am able to view stats on logging in.
    *   After logging a workout, all relevant workouts stats and advice are visible.
    *   No errors occur after the update.

The best option will depend on the level of detail your team prefers in user stories and the context of your project.  Option 3 is probably the most useful given the information we have from the review, as it highlights the urgency and user impact.

"It would be good, but two things make it not worth more than 2 stars: lack of export of the recorded data and really basic, almost unusable map view.",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories based on the user review, prioritized from most to least important (based on the user's wording):

**Highest Priority (Directly addresses main pain points):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to export the data I record so that I can analyze it in other tools or share it with others, because the current inability to export significantly limits the app's usefulness.**

**Second Priority (Addressing the map view issue):**

*   **As a user, I want a clear, functional, and informative map view so that I can easily visualize my recorded data in a geographically relevant context.**
    *   *Alternative more specific version:* **As a user, I want a more feature-rich and user-friendly map view so that I can effectively analyze my recorded data spatially.**

**Combined User Story (Condenses both issues into one):**

*   **As a user, I am unable to give this app a positive review due to the lack of data export functionality and the basic, almost unusable map view, so I want the ability to export my recorded data and a more functional map view to make the app worthwhile.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   I've focused on user-centric language, using ""I want"" and explaining the ""because"" / ""so that"" behind the need.
*   I prioritized the export issue, as it was mentioned first implicitly implying its greater importance.
*   The combined version is good for communication but might make development prioritization harder.
*   I kept the language relatively general for the map view issues, allowing for more flexibility in potential solutions.  A follow-up conversation with the user or further investigation would be needed to understand specific map view deficiencies.

I'm having problems with receiving notifications after last update as I have to reinstall the application to make it useful and then it is no longer receiving notifications again it's a daily habit now The watch is useless without the notifications,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user story options, capturing different aspects of the user's frustration, along with their benefits:

**Option 1 (Focus on the core problem):**

*   **As a user, I want to reliably receive notifications on my watch so I can stay informed without constantly checking my phone.**

    *   **Benefit:** Make the development team aware that the updates have to be tested in order to maintain such functionality

**Choice Rationale:**

*   The **best option depends on engineering team**. If they know that the notification are core option 1 is all they need
*   Options 2 and 3 are good if you want to really hammer home the severity of the issue and the user's negative experience.
*   Option 4 provides valuable context but is more specific and may limit the potential solutions initially considered if no solution found

In essence, all options accurately reflect the user's core desire to have a functioning watch with reliable notifications. The best option would depend on what you need to communicate to the team/what you're trying to emphasize.
