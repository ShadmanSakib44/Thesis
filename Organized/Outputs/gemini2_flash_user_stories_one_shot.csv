Can't link my watchfit as it doesnt appear in device list even after updates. Worse thing is asking for random permissions -camera location call before letting a person use the fitness band.

*   **Option 2** tackles the privacy concerns which is also a very important issue raised.
*   **Option 3** addresses the dependency on the app for basic usage.

**Choosing the best option:**

The ""best"" user story depends on what the product team prioritizes. If they value seamless device integration, Option 1 is ideal. If privacy is a key concern, Option 2 is better. And if they want to enable some basic usability ""out of the box,"" Option 3 would be the priority. You could even create all three!

Lot og bugs. It sucks",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story:

**Breakdown of the Review:**

*   **Stopping during calls:** The app unexpectedly crashes or stops functioning when the user is on a call.
*   **Poor graphics:** The visual presentation of the app is low quality.
*   **Syncing problems:** Data is not reliably synchronized between the app and other systems.

**As a user with an Honor Band 5, I want accurate step count tracking so that I can get a reliable overview of my daily activity levels.**

**Optional (for clarity or prioritization):**

*  **(Context):** As a user with an Honor Band 5 using this app...
*  **(Benefit):** ...so that I can accurately monitor my fitness progress.

**Reasoning for the conversion:**

*   The review primarily highlights the inaccurate step count.  While the user likes the sleep tracking and the heart animation, the negative aspect is prioritized for improvement via the user story.
*   The user story focuses on a specific and actionable request.
*   The ""so that"" part clarifies the user's motivation for wanting the feature (accurate activity tracking).

"Changed phone. Paired vivoactive, but cannot set it as the activity tracker since it already has ""null"" as the activity tracker and cannot be changed. The app is disappointing.

**User Story:** ""As a user who has recently changed phones and paired my vivoactive device, I want to be able to designate my vivoactive as my primary activity tracker, even if the app incorrectly displays ""null"" as the current tracker, so that my activity data is accurately tracked and reflected in the app.""

I loved it until a recent update.  Now I can't sync on my phone and it won't connect to MyFitnessPal. I have to pair it up every time and even then it doesn't always sync.

step count is not correct but it was never a issue for me if it is 2 - 4% but in running its sarting with 10 to 15 % less secount while running scren geting off as normal app which is irritating.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the review into a user story, depending on how granular you want to be:

**Option 1 (Focus on accuracy and screen behavior):**

*   **As a runner, I want the step counter to be more accurate during runs (within a 4% margin of error) and the screen to stay on so that I can reliably track my steps and performance without irritation.**

**Option 2 (Breaking it into two separate stories - more agile friendly):**

*   **As a runner, I want the step counter to be more accurate during runs (within a 4% margin of error) so that I can reliably track my performance.**
*   **As a runner, I want the screen to remain on during runs so that I don't have to constantly interact with the app to view my progress.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   I've assumed the user is a ""runner"" since they mention running. This provides more context.
*   I've quantified the allowed error margin (4%) because the user provides that information. Having specific success criteria makes the story more useful.
*   The user mentions screen behavior. A lot of users will be concerned if their screen keeps turning off, meaning there is justification for splitting this into its own story. If we are using Agile methodology, splitting the story into two will allow for easier and faster completion.

The best option depends on your specific development process and the level of detail you need in your user stories. If you are using the Agile methodology, choose option 2. Otherwise, option 1 covers both points made in the review.

Too many updates and too difficult to navigate to basic stats. Garmin software developers are missing the mark. Provide a lite-version without so many unwanted features or allow more customization to remove all the surplfuous junk. No longer updates after sync up. This occurs even after rebooting forerunner & phone.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting the review into a user story, with slightly different emphasis:

**Option 1 (Focus on Navigation and Bloat):**

""As a user, I want easier navigation to basic stats and the option to remove or disable unwanted features (either through customization or a lite version) so that I can quickly access the information I need and avoid feeling overwhelmed by bloat.""

**Option 2 (Focus on Bug Fixes and Simplicity):**

""As a user, I want the software to reliably update and sync, and I want a more streamlined experience with fewer unnecessary features or the ability to customize the interface, so that I can easily track my stats and don't have to deal with constant updates and a cluttered interface.""

**Option 3 (Breaking it into Multiple User Stories):**

*   ""As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate to basic stats so that I can quickly see core information about my activity.""
*   ""As a user, I want the option to disable or remove features I don't use (either through a lite version or greater customization) so that the app is less cluttered and more focused on my needs.""
*   ""As a user, I want the software to reliably update and sync data from my device so that I can be confident my information is accurate and up-to-date.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Option 1** attempts to capture the key complaints about navigation and feeling overwhelmed by the software.
*   **Option 2** highlights both a bug (not updating) and the desire for simplicity.
*   **Option 3** breaks the review into three separate user stories. This is often preferred in agile development to make tasks smaller and more manageable.  Each story can be independently prioritized and addressed.

I leaned toward these options because the review suggests both usability problems (difficult navigation), feature bloat, and a bug (sync issues).  The best choice depends on how the development team wants to approach addressing the feedback.

It enable itself every time I tried to disable it. ** With the latest update, the problem now is solved. Thanks Huawei",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Since the review indicates the problem has been resolved, it doesn't warrant a user story, which typically describes a desired feature or resolution to a problem. Instead, it's more akin to a bug report and its confirmation of a fix.

However, if we were to interpret the initial problem *before* the fix, we could phrase a user story like this:

Sleep tracker not working since last year. Still not working its August 2020 now🤔 march 2022why won't gt2e watch pair with app.used be so go aswell,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the review into a user story, with slight variations depending on the focus:

"I used to love this app.. now it dosent even work properly. It dosent even count my steps sometime.. really frustrating, also weight management feature is no longer there with the new update.. pointless having this app anymore..",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here's a possible user story breakdown based on the review provided:

**User Story 1 (Addressing basic functionality):**

**User Story 2 (Addressing Feature Removal):**

*   ""As a user, I want the weight management feature to be restored to the app so that I can continue to use it for my weight loss/maintenance goals.""

**Reasoning:**

*   The review highlights two distinct issues: the app's core functionality (step counting) and the removal of a previously existing feature (weight management).
*   Each issue gets its own user story, allowing developers to address them independently.
*  Each user story focuses on the desired outcome from the user's perspective.

Update ruined everything. My data is lost. Rubbish syncing and never updates my steps anymore. Disconnects every few minutes and counts nap when I'm awake. I thought it's firmware issue but turns it it's just this garbage app.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the review into user stories, depending on how granular you want to be:

**Option 1 (Focus on the Core Issues - Most Concise):**

*   ""As a user, I want my data to be reliably synced and preserved after app updates, so I can trust the app to track my activity accurately and consistently.""

**Option 2 (More Detailed, Addressing Specific Problems):**

*   ""As a user, I want my data to be preserved after app updates, so I don't lose my progress and history.""
*   ""As a user, I want reliable syncing that frequently updates my steps, so my activity is always reflected accurately.""
*   ""As a user, I want a stable connection that doesn't disconnect frequently, so the app can track my activity without interruption.""
*   ""As a user, I want the app to accurately distinguish between naps and awake time, so my sleep data is reliable.""

**Option 3 (Broader, Emphasizing Reliability):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to be reliable and stable in its core functions (data syncing, step tracking, connection stability, accurate activity detection) so that I can trust it to provide accurate and consistent data.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   All the options try to avoid the negative language (""ruined,"" ""garbage""). User stories should focus on *what the user wants* rather than *what they dislike*.

*   **Option 1** is the most concise and captures the overall essence of the user's dissatisfaction: a lack of trust and reliability.

*   **Option 2** breaks down the user's issues into more specific, actionable requests. This could be helpful for developers because it clarifies each area that needs improvement.

*   **Option 3** focuses on the high-level goal of reliability but is less specific than option 2.

The best option depends on the context of your project and how you prefer to structure your user stories. If the development team needs very clear, distinct goals, Option 2 is probably best. If you are trying to define high-level goals, Option 1 and 3 are more appropriate.

**User Story:** ""As a user recovering from/preparing for surgeries, I want the step tracking to be highly accurate and reliable so that I can confidently use the app to achieve my health and fitness goals related to my surgeries.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Focus on Accuracy & Reliability:** The core problem seems to be trust in the step tracking accuracy. The user mentions losing someone (presumably weight) despite a high step count, suggesting distrust.
*   **Surgeries Context:** The review mentions surgeries, indicating a specific health and fitness goal related to the app's use, which is important to incorporate.
*   **Motivation:** The user is trying the app again, implying they want it to work and help them with their surgeries. So ""health and fitness goals"" is a fair assumption.

"Pretty good, but some things could be improved eg increase functionality to match the web / PC capability such as download gpx files (for people who do not have a PC); show temperature to one decimal place",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a couple of options for breaking down that review into one or more user stories:

**Option 1 (Combined User Story):**

""As a user, I want the app to have feature parity with the web/PC version, including the ability to download GPX files, and for the temperature to be displayed to one decimal place, so that I can have a consistent and more informative experience across all platforms.""

**Option 2 (Separate User Stories):**

*   ""As a user without access to a PC, I want to be able to download GPX files directly from the app so that I can use them for navigation and other purposes.""

*   ""As a user, I want the temperature to be displayed to one decimal place so that I can have a more precise understanding of the conditions.""

**Reasoning:**

*   **Option 1** keeps the request cohesive as it's all about improving the app's capabilities.
*   **Option 2** breaks it down further. This is useful if downloading GPX files and temperature display are handled by different teams or have different priorities. Splitting them up allows for more granular prioritization and tracking.

**Which option is best depends on the specific development process and team structure.** I would lean towards Option 2 if there's a good reason to prioritize one feature over the other. If they are roughly equal in importance and complexity and can be tackled together easily, Option 1 is fine.

App was great for a long time. But not keeps logging me out and freezing. Very annoying I have to get an email every time I need to log in which is 5 or 6 times a day,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a couple of options for the user story, depending on the focus you want to emphasize:

**Option 1 (Focus on Stability):**

* **Option 1** focuses on the underlying issues highlighted in the review - the unpredictable logging out and the freezing. I think this helps address the core problem the user is experiencing.

* **Option 2** hones in on the specific annoyance of repeated email verifications. This might be useful if your team is considering alternative authentication methods.

One more update. Find a way to give steps for cyclists. There's no way people do hundreds of thousands of steps everyday. It seems dishonest that I don't want to be part of it.. uninstalling..btw the GPS seems to be working fine now.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the breakdown and user story conversion:

**Understanding the Review:**

The review expresses two main points:

1.  **Incorrect Step Counting for Cyclists:** The user believes the app is inaccurately counting steps for cyclists, leading to unrealistically high numbers. This makes them feel excluded and distrustful.
2.  **GPS Functionality:** The user also says that GPS functionality seems to be working fine.

**User Story:**

""As a cyclist, I want the app to accurately track my activity (e.g., distance or active time) instead of counting steps, so I can get a realistic representation of my exercise and stay motivated to use the app.""

"still not fixed :( Google fit syncs sleep now. does not sync heart and sports info. pls allow us to add our own activities info captured on honor band does not include steps climbed. pls have find my band feature, and also band to auto track exercise",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story:

**Analysis of the Review:**

The review identifies several distinct issues:

*   **Google Fit Sync Problems:** Heart rate and sports data do not sync, while sleep data does.
*   **Missing Activity Input:** User wants to manually add activity data from their Honor Band.
*   **Missing Steps Climbed:** Honor Band data lacks steps climbed information.
*   **Missing ""Find My Band"" Feature:** User wants a feature to locate a lost band.
*   **Lack of Auto Exercise Tracking:** User wants the band to automatically detect and track exercise.

**User Story:**

To address these issues, we can create a few user stories.  Here's a suggested primary user story, with sub-tasks potentially branching off:

* **User Story (Focus on Google Sync):** As a user, I want my heart rate and sports activity data from the app to seamlessly sync with Google Fit, so that I can have a complete and accurate view of my overall health and fitness data in one place.

**Consider these Sub-Tasks to support the primary User Story (to cover the rest of the review)**

*   As a user, I want the ability to manually add workout activities or data so that I can include workouts tracked by my Honor Band that are not being automatically synced.
*   As a user, I want the app to include data on steps climbed recorded by my Honor Band.
*   As a user, I want a ""find my band"" feature on my app so that I am able to easily locate my band should it become lost.
*   As a user, I want my smart band to automatically track my exercise so that I don't have to manually record it.

**Why this approach?**

*   **Focus on Value:** Each user story focuses on the user's goal and the benefit they receive.
*   **Testable:** Each user story should be actionable and testable.
*   **Manageable:** Breaking the review into multiple stories makes it easier to prioritize and implement.
*   **Addresses All Points:** The user is requesting quite a bit, and each point is focused on in each section.
*   **Prioritization:** The product manager can then prioritise which elements to action first.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context:** Understanding the app's intended purpose and target audience is key to refine these stories further.
*   **Technical Feasibility:**  The development team needs to assess the feasibility of implementing each feature.
*   **Prioritization:** The product owner will prioritize which user stories to address based on business value and user impact.

So Bad app I can't receive notification well and can't download apps on my watch and the app closes in the background so useless app,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting that review into a user story, with slightly different focuses:

*   **Breaking down the problems:** The review lists several issues: notifications, downloads to the watch, and background running. Each option attempts to consolidate these issues into a cohesive purpose.

Ultimately, the best user story will depend on the specific goals and priorities of your team. I would suggest discussing the options with your team to see which one best addresses the core concerns raised in the review and aligns with your development strategy.

Can't link my watchfit as it doesnt appear in device list even after updates. Worse thing is asking for random permissions -camera location call before letting a person use the fitness band. Why is it even necessary to link the fitness band with the phone to start with? Deeply disappointed,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's a breakdown and a conversion of the review into multiple user stories to address the distinct issues raised:

**Understanding the Review**

The review highlights several problems:

*   **Connectivity Issue:** Inability to connect a ""Watchfit"" device, even after updates.
*   **Unnecessary Permissions:** Concerns about requests for excessive and seemingly unrelated permissions (camera, location, call access) *before* using the fitness band.
*   **Reliance on Phone Link:** Questioning the fundamental requirement of needing a phone link to even begin using the band.

**User Stories (Breaking it down for clarity)**

*   **User Story 1 (Connectivity):**
    *   ""As a user, I want my Watchfit device to be reliably discoverable and connectable to the app so that I can track my fitness data without frustration.""

*   **User Story 2 (Permissions - Transparency and Trust):**
    *   ""As a user, I want to understand *why* the app needs specific permissions (camera, location, call access) *before* granting them, so that I can make an informed decision about my privacy and feel confident the app is trustworthy.""

*   **User Story 3 (Permissions - Minimization):**
    *    ""As a user, I want the app to only request permissions that are essential for the core functionality I'm using at that time, so that I'm not forced to grant unnecessary access to my phone's features.""

*   **User Story 4 (Standalone Functionality Consideration):**
    *   ""As a user, I want to be able to use the core functions of the fitness band (e.g., step tracking, heart rate monitoring) *without* necessarily needing to connect it to the app on my phone, so that I have more flexibility and can still use the band even without immediate phone access.""
"
"Before the update was the best app,  i don't have every day steps counting and nothing that i have interes.  if you don't is fix it , im gone uninstall the app",Samsung Health,problem_report,"As a user, I want the app to restore the features and functionality related to daily step counting and personalized content that were present before the update so that I can continue using the app and track my activity/interests effectively.

It would be cool to have it back!",Samsung Health,feature_request,"As a user, I want to be able to track my caffeine intake so that I can continue to monitor my health and habits as I did before the update.

**As a user, I want the app to seamlessly integrate with popular health platforms like Samsung Health, Google Fit, and Discovery Health, so that my heart rate data and other health information are consistently and automatically synchronized, enhancing the app's usefulness and providing a holistic view of my well-being.**

""As an Honor Band 4 user, I want monthly firmware updates with new and customizable watch faces so that I can keep my device fresh and personalized.""

"Sleep stats are way to conservative since some time (nearly always they require an edit to add sleep time). Also, the app does not want to sync watch data without internet connection - why? What about trying to sync in a remote location out of range?",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here's the conversion of the review into user stories, broken down for clarity:

*   **User Story 1 (Addressing Sleep Stats):** ""As a user, I want the sleep tracking to accurately record my sleep time without requiring frequent manual edits so that I can get a reliable understanding of my sleep patterns.""

*   **User Story 2 (Addressing Offline Data Sync):** ""As a user, I want the app to sync my watch data even when I don't have an internet connection so that I can track my activity and sleep regardless of location.""

*   **Clear Objectives:** Each story focuses on the ""who, what, and why"" of the user need.
*   **Benefit Statement:** The ""so that"" clause in each story explains the benefit to the user.

My activities from My Fitness Pal don't sync into the Connect app. I'm having to enter my workouts manually.  My information such as my picture or personal stats/settings are saving some and not others. My screens look nothing like any of the screenshots or videos.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story conversion:

**Breakdown of the Review:**

*   **Syncing Issue:** Fitness Pal data doesn't sync automatically with the Connect App.
*   **Manual Entry:** The user is forced to manually enter workout data.
*   **Data Saving Inconsistencies:** Profile information (picture, stats, settings) saves inconsistently.
*   **UI Discrepancy:** The app's UI doesn't match the expected look from screenshots and videos.

**User Story Options (Prioritized by frequency and impact)**

Here are a couple of options, breaking the review into multiple user stories for clarity and easier tracking in development:

**Option 1 (Multiple Stories)**

*   ""As a user, I want my activities from My Fitness Pal to automatically sync with the Connect app so that I don't have to manually enter my workout data.""
*   ""As a user, I want my profile information (picture, stats, settings) to consistently save in the Connect app so that my profile is always up-to-date.""
*   ""As a user, I want the Connect App to display a consistent and accurate user interface, one that matches the screenshots and videos, so that I know how and where to find controls to manage my profile and settings.""

**Explanation of Choices**

*   The user stories are phrased in the standard ""As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"" format.
*   I've separated the issues to make them more manageable for development teams to address individually.  Syncing, data saving, and UI problems are distinct areas.
*   The ""so that"" clauses clearly articulate the user's motivation and the benefit they'll receive.

There is zero reason to have sheath invading our privacy with dual verification. Stop overstepping your boundaries because stupid people don't understand what you are doing.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"This review expresses strong negative sentiment about a dual verification process. It also contains inflammatory language and potentially violates content policies. However, focusing solely on the *functional* intent (ignoring the abusive language), we can infer the user's underlying desire to simplify the login process and potentially reduce perceived privacy concerns. Here's a user story capturing that, while avoiding the problematic language:

**User Story:** ""As a user, I want a simpler and faster login process, and I want to understand clearly why any verification steps are necessary, so that I can access the app/service quickly and feel confident in the security measures in place.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Focus on Simplification:**  The complaint is about ""dual verification"" being unnecessary. The user story addresses this by asking for a simpler, faster process.
*   **Add Explanation/Transparency:**  The comment mentions ""privacy"" and people ""don't understand."" This suggests a lack of clarity. The user story addresses this by adding a request for understanding and confidence in security measures.
*   **Avoid Accusation/Abuse:** The original review uses harsh and potentially offensive language. This is completely removed and rephrased in a neutral, constructive way.

*Important Note:* It's crucial to recognize that the original review is potentially toxic and might warrant further investigation into the user's behavior if it's part of a larger pattern. However, the above user story attempts to extract the underlying feedback while adhering to ethical and respectful guidelines.

**Understanding the Review:**

The review expresses multiple problems:

*   **Forced App Store Installation:** Users are forced to use Huawei's App Gallery (which they find poor) to get a compatible version.
*   **Frustration/Usability:** The overall experience is described as ""rubbish and unusable.""

**User Story:**

Here are a few options depending on the focus:

**Option 1 (Focus on Compatibility):**

""As a user with a newer device, I want the app to be compatible with my device so that I can use the app without having to use alternative and inconvenient app stores.""

**Option 2 (Focus on the App Store Issue):**

""As a user, I want to be able to download the app directly from standard app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store) or directly from the developers so that I'm not forced to use potentially less secure or unreliable app stores.""

**Option 3 (More General Focus w/ Multiple Stories):** We could also prioritize splitting these problems into multiple stories to address all issues.

*   **User Story 1:** ""As a user, I want the app to be compatible and functional on current devices so that I can use the apps core functions.""
*   **User Story 2:** ""As a user, I want to be able to download the app from a trusted or standard appstore (Google Play, Apple App Store, etc.) so that I am not concerned about the security of the source appstore."""

Typical garmin. Great hardware and rubbish software. Never connects. Always shows 'mobile connection required' unless app is actually running. Horrible interface. Full of junk you don't want and stuff you do is painful to access.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of the review and how it translates into several user stories:

**Analysis of the Review:**

The user is frustrated with the software despite liking the hardware. Key issues:

*   **Connectivity Problems:** Fails to connect reliably.
*   **App Dependence:** Connectivity is tied to the app actively running.
*   **Poor User Interface:** ""Horrible interface,"" hard to navigate, unintuitive.
*   **Bloat and Lack of Accessibility:** Contains unwanted features while making desired features difficult to find.

**User Stories:**

Given the different points of frustration, it's best to break this into multiple stories to avoid a single, overly broad user story. Here are some potential user stories:

*   **As a user, I want my device to connect to my device automatically in the background so that I can seamlessly sync data without needing to keep the app open.** (Addresses the connectivity and app dependence issues)

*   **As a user, I want a streamlined and intuitive interface so that I can easily find and use the features I need.** (Addresses the poor UI and accessibility issues)

*   **As a user, I want the option to customize the app's interface to remove unnecessary features so that I can focus on the data and functions that are important to me.** (Addresses bloat and personal user preference)

**Alternative Combining Story (Less Ideal):**

While less ideal, you could try to combine some points:

*   **As a user, I want a reliable connection, a cleaner, more intuitive user interface, and to be able to customize the app's features so that I can easily access and use the app's core functionality without frustration.**

I switched to Garmin because they aren't so restrictive with their software. Even on official firmware this garbage app won't run. I'll never buy a Samsung again.,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's a possible user story derived from the review:

**As a user with a specific fitness device (e.g., Garmin), I want the app to be compatible with a wider range of devices and firmware, so that I can use it with my preferred hardware and software setup.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   **Focus on the core complaint:** The user is upset about compatibility issues. The review is highly charged with emotion but the core issue is the app not working with their chosen device setup.
*   **Emphasize the user's perspective:** The story aims to understand why the user is frustrated.
*   **Keep it actionable:** The user story should be a guiding principle.
*   **It is implied that the user is already a user of Samsung products:** They say they will ""never buy"" another one.
*   **The user is likely an athletic hobbyist:** They use a Garmin watch.

**Alternative (more general) User Story:**

**As a user, I want the app to be compatible with a wide range of fitness devices and software, so that I can use it with my preferred hardware and software setup.**

This alternative removes the specific mention of Garmin, making it a broader goal for the app developers. Choosing between these depends on the specific product strategy.
