While the heart rate measurement feature works perfectly fine, I have been experiencing issues with the stress measuring function. Every time I try to use it, the app gets stuck on either ""measuring"" or ""finalizing"" for more than 30 minutes without ever giving me a reading. This has been happening for over 2 years now and it's incredibly frustrating. I need this feature to work properly so I can also monitor my SpO2 levels. If this issue isn't resolved soon, I will have to remove one star from my review. Can someone please explain why this is happening and provide a solution?"

"I've bought Huawei smart scale AH 100. It needs Huawei Health. I have smartphone with Android One. Huawei Health requires Huawei Mobile Service version 4.0.0 or later, but in Google Store there is only version 3.0.3.300! Now I am a ""happy"" owner of stupid scales.

Otherwise good app. Syncs some activities to Google Fit, but misses most of the data.",Huawei Health,feature_request,"As a avid athlete who loves tracking my activities, I was excited to start using the Watch GT. However, I quickly became disappointed when I found out that it doesn't allow integration with services like Strava.

Overall, I highly recommend this app for anyone looking to monitor their activity levels and reach their fitness goals."

"I like the food tracking feature and other options, although some feel gimmicky.

However, I have noticed that some features feel a bit gimmicky to me.

One thing that really bothers me is that Samsung failed to mention that some meals contain more than one gram of sodium, but the input for sodium on the app is capped at 999.9 mg. This limitation is frustrating because it doesn't accurately reflect the sodium content of certain meals.

I guess this means I should probably stop eating Chipotle, as their meals are likely to exceed the app's sodium input cap. Despite this drawback, I still find the food tracking feature helpful in my quest for better health."
