"Keep getting banned on Facebook for random things, like posting a video of my own daughter walking, and things taken out of context. Even when Facebook review and realise they made a mistake and admit to it and apologise they dont remove that data stored on you so your account is constantly harassed and silenced!!

"I have been locked out of my account for 2 weeks now after being hacked.  I have contacted Facebook via email relentlessly as Incan not access the help or report section of the platform.  This has caused me to be locked out of my Instagram account as well.
I use the platforms for my business.  My customers think that we have gone out of business.

"For all the good Meta does in keeping us connected your company, your leadership and enablers have hooked users to over sharing and over exposure.  In so doing this corporation parasitically intentionally feeds on our unconscious insecurities and shadow via algorithms.  This leads to profound suffering and loss of intimate connections.

I believe there deserves to be a class action lawsuit to hold FacebookMeta and its leadership accountability for the incredible political,  societal and individual harm their endless selfish greedy quest for power through data manipulation has wrought.",2,"As a concerned user who has experienced the negative effects of social media overuse, I want Meta (Facebook) to prioritize ethical design, transparency, and accountability in its platform, so that users can enjoy meaningful connections without being exploited by algorithms that prey on insecurities and encourage overexposure.","As a user concerned about the negative impacts of social media, I want Facebook/Meta to be held accountable for the harm caused by its algorithms and data manipulation practices, which I believe exploit users' insecurities, promote oversharing and overexposure, and ultimately damage individual well-being and societal connections.

"The site not only has bias on every topic, but they also dont allow the user any privacy.

Its fine until I go to my profile to see view as and cant look at my pics.

"13 years I trusted this site with my life.. only to find out its a data collecting agent of China , pushing communism with its sensoring and false narratives.

"My 15 year old account got hacked and disabled with 2 factor identification on. Facebook reported to have made 116 billion dollars in 2022, but cant afford customer service. I cant recover my account because it was disabled. Facebook also took the liberty to disable my Instagram account. Both disabled with no review. I have never caused in issue on either apps going against there terms and agreements. But I learned a valuable lesson, you dont have any rights to your profiles, pictures, conversations, or business information etc, they can take it away and not give it back at any given time. I have spent many hours researching, sending emails, trying different things etc. to no avail. Thanks Facebook for the complete disappointment and for completely not caring about your customers.",2,"As a loyal user with a 15-year-old account, I feel deeply frustrated and powerless after my Facebook and Instagram accounts were hacked, disabled, and left unreviewed, despite having 2-factor authentication enabled.

"I like to delete andor hide almost everything I have previously seen from FB on a daily basis. Now FB is sending out more of their own garbage than I get from friends. Even though I have clearly requested NO memories, they keep sending more and more. Their reporting system is a waste of time. The buttons on anything they send you dont work and when used just eats up data for hours at a time. I am flooded with Suggested Pages, Friendverseries, Videos, etc and the buttons dont work. The more you report, the more they send.",2,"As a frequent Facebook user who values a clean and personalized feed, I want to have better control over the content I see and the ability to effectively hide or delete unwanted posts, memories, and suggestions, so that my feed is more relevant and enjoyable, and I don’t feel overwhelmed by irrelevant or repetitive content.","As a user who prefers a clean and personalized feed, I want Facebook to respect my preferences for hiding or deleting past content and to significantly reduce the amount of unwanted suggested content, including memories, pages, friendversaries, and videos.  I also want the reporting system to function properly so I can effectively remove unwanted content, and I want the ""hide"" and ""delete"" buttons on these suggestions to work reliably, rather than being non-responsive and consuming excessive data.

notifications."
"It is amazing that Facebook refuses to listen to those who want to use the app but find it a waste of time.  We know you make your money by ads, we could care less.  I have seen thousands of requests to allow users to set how they see their feed, most recent, all comments, etc. but you continue to shovel feed with comments most relevant a unique way to say we will only show you what we want you to see, top posts instead of all posts, again a way of censoring.  This truly is becoming the most inconvenient way of trying to communicate while being the biggest corporation spying on everyones action including what you do on the net that has nothing to do with Facebook.  Their trackers are monetizing every action you do.",2,"As a Facebook user who values transparency and control over my feed and privacy, I want the ability to customize how I view my feed (e.g., most recent posts, all comments, no algorithmic filtering) and limit invasive tracking, so that I can communicate and interact on the platform without feeling censored, spied on, or overwhelmed by irrelevant content.","As a user, I want Facebook to give me control over my feed, allowing me to choose how content is displayed (e.g., most recent, all comments) instead of forcing me to see ""top posts"" or content curated by algorithms that prioritize ""most relevant"" comments. I believe these curated feeds are a form of censorship and manipulation.  I'm also concerned about Facebook's extensive tracking practices, both on and off the platform, and how this data is being used and monetized.","As a Facebook user,
I want the ability to control how my feed is displayed (e.g., most recent, all comments) and better privacy protections,

"This app has completely went downhill !!! NOT A LICK OF FREEDOM LEFT , THEY MONITOR ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFO EVEN WHEN APP ISNT BEING USED.

"If you want your data stolen, download this app. If you want Facebook to spy on you, download this app. If you want your data sold, download this app. Constantly having to change settings so they do not have access to my camera, mic, contacts etc. after each update is just incredibly messed up.

"This app spread so much hate and evil. It destroyed families, friendships, relationships. It took jobs and spread racism, sexism, and immorality. It basically fathered all the other toxic apps like tiktok, bigo, and it eventually corrupted fun apps like instagram when it took over. We lost our privacy, we lost freedom and we lost our children in many ways. This app was the worst thing to happen to a global society. Its nothing like myspace was or yahoo which frankly pioneered social media but didnt get recognized for its stolen tech.

"Facebook tracks users of google to websites they visit after doing searches evidenced by targeted ads which is an invasion of privacy.

Facebook invades users privacy by using certain types of technology Apples Siri for example to listen into personal private conversations evidenced by extremely direct targeted ads that appear on users feed within hours of private conversation.  These ads are not related to anything the user has ever posted or commented about on Facebook, any other social media, or anywhere on the internet.

Im giving Facebook one star because I cant leave them negative stars lol. Anyway Facebook is so easy to hack.

"im guessing they have such a monopoly on social media that the company and developers have nearly no incentive to fix anything. ive had the same exact bugs persist across devices an major OS updates. 

ones I can recall atm that frustrate me to no end
video resets every time I rotate the screen
opening facebook kills my background audio
no dark mode on ipad not a bug, just a complaint

"Facebook has a Broken 2 Factor Authentication System. My facebook has two different linked accounts. Unfortunately it doesnt have my mobile number linked so it made it even worse to recover my account. I recently got my i phone 8 replaced because the screen of my older phone broke completely which meant my phone still worked but the screen didnt which gave me no acess to the phone so i had to replace it to another i phone 8. Everything transfered smoothly from one phone to another.
