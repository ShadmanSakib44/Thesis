Even when Facebook review and realise they made a mistake and admit to it and apologise they dont remove that data stored on you so your account is constantly harassed and silenced!!

"I have been locked out of my account for 2 weeks now after being hacked.  I have contacted Facebook via email relentlessly as Incan not access the help or report section of the platform.  This has caused me to be locked out of my Instagram account as well.
I use the platforms for my business.  My customers think that we have gone out of business.  I spent hours on the phone with my carrier and Apple thinking that something was wrong either with the phone or my carrier.  Its Facebook.   Short codes are coming in from everyone else except them, and they have yet to reply.",2," User Story: A business owner had their Facebook account hacked and locked out for 2 weeks. They've been unsuccessful in contacting Facebook via email or accessing the platform's help/report feature. This issue caused their linked Instagram account to also become inaccessible. Being unable to manage their social media presence led customers to mistakenly believe they went out of business. The user spent time troubleshooting with their phone carrier and manufacturer before identifying Facebook as the main source of the problem. They are frustrated by unresponsive communication from Facebook, even though short codes from other sources work fine on their device."
"For all the good Meta does in keeping us connected your company, your leadership and enablers have hooked users to over sharing and over exposure.  In so doing this corporation parasitically intentionally feeds on our unconscious insecurities and shadow via algorithms.  This leads to profound suffering and loss of intimate connections.  This has been my experience.  I believe there deserves to be a class action lawsuit to hold FacebookMeta and its leadership accountability for the incredible political,  societal and individual harm their endless selfish greedy quest for power through data manipulation has wrought.",2," User Story: An individual expresses concerns about Meta's platform (specifically Facebook/Meta) exacerbating over-sharing and insecurity issues among users through algorithms. This leads to negative impacts on personal relationships, society, and politics. The user advocates for a class action lawsuit against the corporation and its leadership to address the harmful consequences of data manipulation and power pursuit."
"The site not only has bias on every topic, but they also dont allow the user any privacy.

This is very close to communistnazi behavior and is unacceptable in a free country.",2," User Story: The website is perceived as biased by the user, who values privacy and openness. They feel frustrated by censorship of content deemed as false or removed, comparing the platform's actions to authoritarian regimes. This contradicts their expectation of freedom of speech and unbiased information in a democratic country."

It was invented by CIA to watch us",1," User Story: A dissatisfied individual perceives Facebook as overly politically engaged, with excessive censorship and privacy concerns.

Concerns also arise about potential misuse of private information shared on the platform."
Its fine until I go to my profile to see view as and cant look at my pics. I want to be able to look at my pics while in view as because its easier to see what pics and videos of mine that complete strangers can see instead of going through all the pics and videos and changing their individual privacy settings. Can yall fix that please,2," User Story: The platform should enable a seamless profile navigation experience. When viewing one's own profile in ""View As"" mode, users want to be able to see their pictures and videos as if they were publicly visible. This feature would save time by allowing users to assess the accessibility of their content at a glance without manually adjusting privacy settings for each post. The development team should prioritize fixing this issue for user convenience."

"My 15 year old account got hacked and disabled with 2 factor identification on. Facebook reported to have made 116 billion dollars in 2022, but cant afford customer service. I cant recover my account because it was disabled. Facebook also took the liberty to disable my Instagram account. Both disabled with no review. I have never caused in issue on either apps going against there terms and agreements. But I learned a valuable lesson, you dont have any rights to your profiles, pictures, conversations, or business information etc, they can take it away and not give it back at any given time. I have spent many hours researching, sending emails, trying different things etc. to no avail. Thanks Facebook for the complete disappointment and for completely not caring about your customers.",2," User Story: A frustrated user with a 15-year-old hacked and disabled account across both Facebook and Instagram platforms despite having enabled two-factor identification. The user is unable to recover their accounts due to disabling without proper review. They express concerns over the lack of ownership on personal profiles, content, and business data, as well as dissatisfaction with the non-existent customer support. Despite investing time researching solutions and reaching out through emails, the user's issues remain unresolved, leading to disappointment with Facebook as a whole."
"I like to delete andor hide almost everything I have previously seen from FB on a daily basis. Now FB is sending out more of their own garbage than I get from friends. Even though I have clearly requested NO memories, they keep sending more and more. Their reporting system is a waste of time.

The more you report, the more they send.",2," User Story: An individual is frustrated with Facebook as they continuously receive unwanted content (memories, suggested pages, friend suggestions, videos) despite requesting no memories and using reporting features. The user aims for improved control over their feed, efficient removal options, and an end to receiving excess non-requested content from the platform."
"It is amazing that Facebook refuses to listen to those who want to use the app but find it a waste of time.  We know you make your money by ads, we could care less.  I have seen thousands of requests to allow users to set how they see their feed, most recent, all comments, etc. but you continue to shovel feed with comments most relevant a unique way to say we will only show you what we want you to see, top posts instead of all posts, again a way of censoring.  This truly is becoming the most inconvenient way of trying to communicate while being the biggest corporation spying on everyones action including what you do on the net that has nothing to do with Facebook.  Their trackers are monetizing every action you do.",2," User Story: The individual expresses frustration about Facebook not addressing user feedback for customizable feed options and prioritizing ads over user preferences. They want more control, like sorting posts by recency or viewing all comments, but Facebook continues to showcase its own selection of content. Concerns are also raised regarding Facebook's invasive tracking practices that monitor users' actions even outside the platform."
"This app has completely went downhill !!! NOT A LICK OF FREEDOM LEFT , THEY MONITOR ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFO EVEN WHEN APP ISNT BEING USED. If you try to change your own personal information, you cant until after 30 security questions then it still wont let you. BEYOND POLITICAL AND RACIST. Quick to flag people of color posts but let them be white they can say all the racists things on social media that they want !",2," User Story: The app has significantly deteriorated in performance. There's a lack of privacy and freedom as it continues to monitor personal information even when not in use. Changing account settings proves challenging with a 30-question security barrier, and the platform often displays political bias and condones racism. Posts by people of color are quickly flagged while white users can freely spread racist content without consequence."

The user seeks guidance on recovering their hacked Facebook account and regaining access to its valuable content and connections."
"If you want your data stolen, download this app. If you want Facebook to spy on you, download this app. If you want your data sold, download this app. Constantly having to change settings so they do not have access to my camera, mic, contacts etc. after each update is just incredibly messed up. Download at your own risk! I will never get back on this app",2,"User Story: Individual expresses strong concerns about privacy and security issues with an app, citing potential data theft, unwanted surveillance by Facebook, unauthorized access to the camera, microphone, and contacts, as well as constant need to reset settings post-updates. The user unequivocally states that they will not be reusing this app due to its persistent privacy violations."

Users feel their data privacy is compromised as the platform meticulously tracks and collects extensive user activity and allegedly unauthorized access to microphones."

Currently, Lori's page displays a different individual instead of herself."

They have an updated app and have tested it on other devices with success, seeking assistance to fix the issue on their account and enable the avatar feature for personal usage."
"This app spread so much hate and evil. It destroyed families, friendships, relationships. It took jobs and spread racism, sexism, and immorality. It basically fathered all the other toxic apps like tiktok, bigo, and it eventually corrupted fun apps like instagram when it took over. We lost our privacy, we lost freedom and we lost our children in many ways. This app was the worst thing to happen to a global society. Its nothing like myspace was or yahoo which frankly pioneered social media but didnt get recognized for its stolen tech. The ceo allowed hate speech and fake news to destroy the dignity of government office. If less than 1 was possible I would give it",1," User Story: The individual expresses strong dissatisfaction with a social media platform, as it resulted in the breakdown of families, friendships, and relationships.

The user criticizes the CEO for allowing hate speech and fake news that undermined government offices' integrity. If a rating lower than 1 was possible, the user would have chosen it."

Apple made it so permission is needed to track what I look at on other sites yet its pretty obvious youre not following this.

They appreciate Facebook's original concept but desire transparency and an explanation from the platform regarding their current data tracking policies.
I cant trust this company after hearing about the censoring and the personal info watching. I immediately deleted the app and deactivated my account.

Regardless of what privacy settings you have on your account.,2," User Story: An individual expresses distrust in a company due to concerns about data censorship and monitoring of personal information. They swiftly removed the app from their device, deactivated their account, and hoped that these actions limited the company's access to their data despite previous privacy settings applied on their account."
"If I could give 0 zero stars I would or even negative 5 stars better. After being on FakeBook for 13 years and not once being put in FakeMo jail, I ended up in jail 1 week before the 2020 Election because I supported DJT our true President. I never went back and will never go back. Im done being censored or told what to thinksay. Im a true Patriot and Constitutional Conservative, I refuse to be tracked by anyone. Im telling you conservatives that Telegram is there for you. We have everything and more with that great app. As far as Messenger? Theres an app for that too. Its Signal and it is encrypted, safe and private. I can keep track of all my family and friends. Please LEAVE FakeBook Twitter and IG!

No tracking, no selling your data. Disable Google and all their cookies!",2," The user story revolves around a dissatisfied Facebook user with a conservative political stance. They had been locked out of their account during the 2020 Election period due to supporting a particular candidate. They've decided not to return to Facebook, citing issues with censorship and tracking. In its place, they recommend Telegram for communication, Signal as an encrypted messaging app, and moving away from social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter. For search engines, the user suggests DuckDuckGo and Presearch, highlighting their focus on privacy and non-tracking features, along with avoiding Google and its associated data collection practices."
"This is without a doubt the worst social media app available. Its losing subscribers at an alarming rate. They spy on you even when your phone is off they are listening.They track your habits and attempt to influence the way you think, what you buy, and even how you vote. Their mind control tactics are synchronized in conjunction with Google and Twitter. So if youre really interested in going full AOC communist I recommend you get the whole package.",2," User Story: An individual expresses strong dissatisfaction with a social media app due to concerns about privacy invasions, such as continuous listening even when phone is off, tracking habits, and influencing thoughts and actions through possible collaboration with Google and Twitter.

Facebook lies Facebook sells your data Facebook manipulates people by show them false information that fits there agenda but when you actually give out real facts and real studys they ban you for false information or dangerous individuals all facebook does is brainwash the masses and take away our rights. Facebook thinks they are so powerful they can do whatever they want like take away your first amendment rights of freedom of speech because it doesnt fit the narrative Facebook doesnt let you participate in the second amendment you try to show anything related to the second amendment and your banned for violence.

This user perceives Facebook, along with Instagram and Twitter, as having a communist control that seeks global dominance by suppressing the truth."

"Ive had an account for 13 years and spent thousands in advertising. I have memories on my personal account from people who are no longer alive. My account was hacked and the hackers posted something bad.

The current setup causes eye strain when switching between accounts due to the abrupt transition from dark to bright interface. By implementing a consistent dark mode option across all profiles, users can more effectively manage their fan pages without discomfort."
"Facebook tracks users of google to websites they visit after doing searches evidenced by targeted ads which is an invasion of privacy.  Facebook censors users in various ways removing comments or posts claiming the user removed it when that is not a fact, fact checking opinions opinions are not facts, just users speaking their mind and Facebook doesnt like their opinions, giving warningsputting users in Facebook jail they cant post or comment for a specific period of time, if user disagrees time is extended or suspending users account, even not allowing users the ability to post scientific based evidence of specific topics that they dont like instead of letting users decide for themselves.  Facebook invades users privacy by using certain types of technology Apples Siri for example to listen into personal private conversations evidenced by extremely direct targeted ads that appear on users feed within hours of private conversation.  These ads are not related to anything the user has ever posted or commented about on Facebook, any other social media, or anywhere on the internet.

Apparently Facebook, specifically Mark Zuckerberg, believes he has every right to violate our rights, but we have no rights at all.",2," User Story: The website (Facebook) is perceived by users as infringing on their privacy. They believe Facebook tracks user searches from platforms like Google and serves targeted ads based on it.

Such practices have personally impacted users and raise concerns about violations of their rights by Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg."
"Flagging words, and then auto labeling content as factcheck to be missing content or partially incorrect, does NOT make you look smart.  There is NO WAY you can fact check personal information like the death of family member and say it is wrong when you do not know the family member.  You also cant factcheck a meme or photo.  
The FACT is FB is biased and needs a whole new overhaul!",1," User Story: The individual expresses frustration with the inaccurate flagging and labeling of personal content as ""factcheck"" on Facebook without proper understanding or authority to validate such information. They believe there's an inherent bias within the platform and insist on a significant revamp to address these issues."
"If you tipped Stalinburg upside down the entire CCP would fall out of his pocket. He employs CCP infiltrated staff to fact check and enforces fascism into his company standards by forcibly oppressing any opposition to his leftist, wokeracist, covidmaskvaxx worshipping ideologies. PS  Facebook isnt social media, its a data mining app that will be used against you in the future.",2," User Story: An individual expresses strong dissatisfaction with a platform possibly referring to a large tech company (e.g., Stalinburg or CCP could represent Chinese influence). The user alleges that biased fact-checkers and staff aligned with a specific political ideology enforce strict censorship on opposing viewpoints, transforming it into a non-social social media environment. This person believes that the platform is primarily designed to collect user data which might be used against them in future situations, particularly referring to Facebook."
Im giving Facebook one star because I cant leave them negative stars lol. Anyway Facebook is so easy to hack. I recently had my account hacked on 122521 and ever since then Ive been trying to reach the facebooks security team. Both by phone and email that is provided and no luck. Whoever stole my Facebook changed the email and everything no matter what I do I cant get it back. So like I said I tried to contact Facebook and no one seems to care. What was supposed to be a fun social media app has turned into a nightmare for me. I use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends far away from me and share pictures of our families.

I mean who hacks facebooks really its not like you got anything from me just a page with pictures and happy positive posts. But whatever.,2," User Story: The user, frustrated by their hacked Facebook account on 12/25/21, is dissatisfied with the platform's security measures as they were unable to regain access or contact Facebook's support team effectively despite multiple attempts via phone and email.

They emphasize that they have always followed the guidelines and maintained appropriate content on their page, questioning why it was targeted by a hacker."
"Im in Facebook jail without due process. They cant show me where I violated COMMUNITY STANDARDS, so essentially you are at their mercy and all they do is use your data.

Hatebook is going away like AOL and YAHOO",2," User Story: The individual expresses frustration with being temporarily blocked on Facebook (Facebook jail) without clear explanation or reference to violated Community Standards. They have concerns about data privacy, user control, and the platform's overall quality deterioration due to bots and an increasing toxic environment. As a result, they predict Facebook will decline in popularity, similar to AOL and Yahoo."
Account was hacked and quickly lockeddisabled. Managed to change password but unable to progress with account recovery as I cant receive any text codes from their system. Looked into contacting customer support.. literally nothing. Some kind of help desk FAQ that is useless.. no phone number or email. Found a number but only a useless robot that led to nothing. Looked and noticed its happening to hundreds.. and scammers are taking advantage or causing it in the first place to pose as customer support to naive consumers. Where they then ask for money or personal information for help. What a joke.,2," User Story: The individual experienced a hacking incident, locking their account. They managed to change the password but faced issues receiving text codes for recovery.

"Been trying to log into my account, but cant because the phone number and email on it are listed on other accounts too. Thank god I can steal several others accounts instead of logging into my own due to lack of support. They offer it, but for businesses and ad purchasers only.

Most of which isnt helpful at all.",2," User Story: An individual struggles to access their account due to shared login credentials with other existing accounts. Frustrated by the inadequate personal support, they exploit other accounts as a workaround. The platform prioritizes assistance for businesses and advertisers while providing generic and unhelpful FAQ-style guidance for personal users."

Dark mode is missing from the App Settings and Privacy on the iPad Pro..why? It works without problem on my iPhoneit doesnt make sense.

They mention that dark mode works fine on their iPhone and find it inconsistent and incongruous across devices.

"All the censorship, political and otherwise is despicable.  This program was founded in America but it was founded on the most unAmerican ideals possible.  They will scour and steal every bit of data about you, they will track everything you do, and everywhere you go and in return they will silence and censor your opinions.  They may as well attempt direct enslavement as it is clear they want nothing more than absolute control.  Pathetic, and disgusting behavior unbecoming of the civilized world.",1," User Story: An individual is expressing strong dissatisfaction with a platform's privacy and censorship policies. They believe the platform, originally created in America, deviates from its core values by excessively collecting user data, monitoring online activity, and geolocations. The user perceives this behavior as an attempt to control opinions and curtail freedom of speech, considering it uncivilized and disgraceful."
"I hate that there is no one to talk to. My account was hacked after having it for 11 years and they changed my recovery email but anytime I sent in my IDs to add a new recovery email it said the information did not match the info on the account you mean the account that someone else probably changed by now!? You mean the thousands of photos dont match my drivers license or any of the past posts?? Like why dont you let me answer my security questions or ask me questions about my account to PROVE that its mine!! I was also told it would be deleted in 30 days if not claimed. I was sad. It relieved because I dont want some stranger to have all of that! And yet its still up.. Ive reported it, had other friends report it. Blocked it.

I understand needing advertising for profit but this is ridiculous. Way to sell out!

Is the app incredibly glitchy even though it really shouldnt be? Yes. Will Facebook steal all data they could possibly obtain and sell it without your consent? Yes.

Delete the app and delete your account.",2," User Story: The website/app is experiencing significant technical issues, including instability, bugs, and persistent problems with dark mode. It's accused of excessive resource usage and battery drainage. Additionally, users are concerned about its intrusive privacy practices allowing Facebook to access phone permissions and gather data without user interaction. Addressing the privacy issue requires multiple steps and resets after updates. The dissatisfied user strongly encourages others to delete both the app and their Facebook accounts due to the company's questionable ethics."
I have been a facebook customer for several years and recently had my account hacked. I have reached out so many times to have this corrected without result. I have decided that it is a poor application especially given that they can take your information and do whatever they want with it!,2," User Story: A long-time Facebook user, who's faced an account hacking incident recently, shares frustration due to unresolved support requests for rectifying the issue. Concerned about data privacy and misuse, this individual is considering leaving the platform because of perceived inadequate app security and poor customer service response."
"you are no longer able to restrict profiles eventhough the option is there if you jump through enough hoops, BUT you get an error when you try to add someone to the list. It used to be simply on the persons profile just as ""remove friend"" is. Next we will be unable to remove friends and unable to delete accounts with error messages for each. Just a shame Going back to MYSPACE!!!",1," The user expresses frustration in their review, highlighting an issue where they can no longer effectively restrict or manage certain profiles despite the availability of related options. Originally, this action was accessible directly on a person's profile. However, now it generates errors and additional steps are required. Dissatisfaction escalates as the user anticipates further limitations to remove friends and delete accounts in the future. They nostalgically prefer the freedom offered by an alternative platform (Myspace)."
"My account was hacked and the support line was absolutely no help whatsoever. I was accused of posting something against their standards of child sexual exploitation and unable to get access back to my account. Lost over 10 years of photos and memories. To top it off, I created a new Facebook and after 1 day theyve prohibited me from liking, commenting, or posting.",2," User Story: An individual experienced an account hack on their platform and encountered unhelpful support when reporting the issue. They were falsely accused of violating content standards and lost valuable memories and photos due to being unable to regain access. Despite creating a new account, they faced limitations on basic functionalities like liking, commenting, or posting after just one day."
From their censorship to their use of your private information Facebook is an echo chamber of whatever they want you to hear. Repeatedly blocking and censoring anything that doesnt fit their agenda. What a joke! byefacebook,2," User Story: The dissatisfied user highlights concerns about privacy, censorship, and biased content curation on Facebook. They believe the platform restricts and filters information based on its own agenda rather than promoting diverse viewpoints and open discussions. Review quote: ""What a joke! ByeFacebook."""

"They havent changed much when it comes to privacy, anyone can still share your pics. They dont prevent online bullying. They let people manage local groups that dont even live in the target area. There is no customer support so dont bother trying to reach out to anyone because there is no one to reach out to. I tried to think of something positive I could say about Facebook but nothing comes to mind its just a waste of time. And I also believe that Facebook starts conflicts because they think your value is based on how many likes you get in life just to make you feel inadequate. I cant tell you how many times Ive deleted this stupid app thinking itd be different or better in some way after two years but nope Facebook still does one thing thats consistent, disappoint.",1," User Story: The individual is dissatisfied with Facebook's privacy measures, absence of anti-bullying features, and inaccurate local group management. They emphasize the lack of customer support and perceive it as a time waste. Facebook's focus on likes exacerbates feelings of inadequacy, leading the user to repeatedly delete the app without noticing improvements over two years. The key takeaway from this story is that the user wants enhanced privacy, effective anti-bullying mechanisms, accurate local group moderation, reliable customer support, and a change in the platform's core values to promote positive engagement."

When I followed facebooks recovery steps which included submitting a copy of my photo ID I was told they still couldnt verify my identity so my account was basically just gone forever.,2," User Story: An individual experienced an unfortunate account hack where login credentials were altered. They went through Facebook's recovery process, providing a copy of their photo ID, but the platform failed to re-verify their identity. Consequently, they lost access to their account permanently.

",2," User Story: An individual encountered an account hacking issue on Facebook and faced a lack of assistance from the platform's support team.

"Looks like the app doesnt recognize my current password when Im prompted to login again to access my account info.  And Im hesitant to logout of the app completely and back in again to try to reset this for fear Ill be locked out of the app until this bug is fixed!

FYI, I did change my password via the website a few months ago, so the app may be recognizing the old password.",2," User Story: The individual faces an issue with the app as it doesn't accept their updated password when logging in. This occurred after changing the password through the web version a few months ago. Out of concern that further actions might result in being locked out, they are hesitant to log out and potentially encounter more complications. Ensuring consistency between the password update process on both app and website is necessary to resolve this issue."
"I have had this facebook account for 14 years with loads of memories on it. I have been hacked for the last 3 months and the person changed the email address, and added a code generator so that I would not be able to get access to it. I have submitted my ID 4 times with no success, and have tried to submit and report the issue, but every time it just tells me that it could not process my request. Facebook should have somewhere we can actually communicate with humans so this wouldnt be an issue. Wish I had access to all my memories.",2," User Story: A long-time user with 14 years of Facebook history laments being hacked for three months. The hacker changed the linked email and added a code generator, blocking access.

They desperately desire to regain control over their memories and cherished moments stored on Facebook."

Also protect peoples privacy instead of abusing it without their permissions.,2," User Story: The individual expresses concern about Facebook's practices, alleging that it mutes opposing viewpoints, caters to its founder's political biases, and misuses user data without permission.

For the second time as a member of Facebook my Facebook account had been hacked!!!! I have received Facebook messages from over 40 friends about the hack but I am unable to see what the hack says.  I am one of the moderators for a Facebook Page entitled Huntsville Standard Poodles and cannot even access that site!!!,2," User Story: The Facebook user expresses frustration with their account being hacked for the second time. They're aware of messages from friends regarding the issue, but unable to view them. As a moderator for the ""Huntsville Standard Poodles"" Facebook Page, they also can't access it. Stronger security measures and improved communication during hack incidents are required for a better user experience."
Fact checkers are not real.  They are lying and covering up actual information.   Just because the news doesnt say its true doesnt mean its not true.  Facebook is a joke.  They spy on us and lie.  Delete this communistic loving crap app now!  Down with the fb!!!  Hello FBI,2," User Story: The user expresses strong dissatisfaction with fact-checking practices, claiming they conceal truth and misrepresent information. They argue that news labeling something as untrue does not necessarily make it false. The platform under scrutiny here is Facebook, which the user accuses of spying on users and dishonesty.

My account got hacked and it is so hard to contact someone from a tech support to help in anyway. I cant get my account back now because someone changed all of my information. I cant even redownload the Facebook app.,2,"User Story: An individual experienced an account hack on their platform, specifically facing difficulties in reaching out to technical support. The user is frustrated as their account's information has been altered by the hacker. Consequently, they are unable to reinstall the Facebook app and regain control over their compromised account."
I now have to completely delete the app when logging out. It will not disconnect. Ever. The circular symbol keeps spinning. It will not let me disconnect. I believe it is either uploading or downloading data. I do not have trust. I simply delete the app every single time I use it. Then download the app again. And it is disconnected and opens fine but again I have to delete and redownload. This is very annoying and tedious.,2," User Story: The individual frequently encounters issues with logging out from the app, as the circular symbol keeps spinning without completion. Consequently, they must uninstall and reinstall the app every time for a successful disconnection. This repetitive process is highly inconvenient due to concerns about ongoing data uploads/downloads, causing a lack of trust in the app's functionality."
As Facebook is phasing out human support and replacing them with bots this app basically harvests your info and sells it while restricting your account for posting Stewie Griffin memes. F   Dont even buy their metaverse crap gear. Terrible.,1," User Story: An individual expresses dissatisfaction with a platform due to its diminishing human support and replacement with bots. They are concerned about the platform's privacy practices, as they perceive it to be misusing user information for profit and limiting content (e.g., Stewie Griffin memes).

"Social media platforms, like Facebook, are poison to your mind. They sell your data and are building a digital profile of you, all the things you like, dislike, hope or wish for, and fear is in your digital profile. Not to mention this platform is designed to be addicting so that you keep coming back... Think about the last time that you opened Facebook. Did you make the conscious choice to do it, or are you just doing it by habit? Get off of Facebook and start living your life again.
1 year clean off of Facebook ",2," User Story: The individual expresses strong dissatisfaction with social media platforms like Facebook due to concerns about data privacy and manipulative addictive design.

"The scrolling feature is acting really off the past couple of days. I even deleted the app and redownloaded it. I have the most up to date iOS. It scrolls whacky like you are being remotely hacked. The app isnt acting right. The FB app behaves like right as your phone dies things start acting delayed and reallllly slow or superrrrr sped up. . . That is how the scrolling feature is acting on the FB app, and nothing else on my phone behaves this way. It is just the FB app when you scroll in your news feed. 

FIX THIS!",2," User Story: The Facebook app user is experiencing significant issues with the scrolling feature in the newsfeed section. They have tried reinstalling and have an up-to-date iOS, but the problem persists. The erratic scrolling behavior is exclusive to the app and worsens when the phone battery is low. This has a negative impact on the user's overall experience, leading them to prioritize fixing this specific issue."
Facebook generates its incomprehensibly massive revenue off of the account holders. The account holders own the personal data within the account. Common decency in business practice would uphold the priority of a strong symbiosis between the two. This is not the operating practice of this company. Unethical business practice is the dismal reality the account holders are left to face. And share holders are likely not far behind.,2," User Story: The Facebook platform significantly benefits financially from its users' data, yet prioritizes its own interests over user privacy and ethical business practices. Users expect a stronger symbiotic relationship between the service and their personal information. Consequently, there is a growing concern regarding the company's unethical behavior among both users and shareholders."
"Ive been getting error fetching data errors every 20 seconds. I cant even use the app anymore. Ive tried all trouble shooting options. My last profile was hacked and no one responded to my emails about it, so I assume Ill have to make another profile again if this error doesnt stop on its own.",1,"User Story: The individual consistently experiences data fetching errors every 20 seconds, rendering the app unusable. Previous attempts to troubleshoot issues were unsuccessful and a hacked profile went unaddressed despite reaching out via email. As a result, creating a new profile is considered if the current error persists without any support from the platform."
"Facebook used to be cool then it went to trash as everyone realized its gov started and owned,then it helped the horrible outcome of our elections, and overall we all need to hop off it and goto FreeTalk45 for less policing and freedom to say what you want on your stuff. No biometric data needed. You shouldnt have to add personal Information to an app just to use it.",2," User Story: An individual expresses dissatisfaction with Facebook due to perceived government ties, interference in elections, and privacy concerns. They advocate for a switch to FreeTalk45, which guarantees less content moderation and freedom of speech without requiring biometric or excessive personal information as a condition for using the platform."
"Im tired of being harassed, silenced, put in timeout for having an opinion. Im tired of not being able to love my country, President. God. Im embarrassed Facebook is even part of America! Not to mention they stalk you, listen in on your phone when you arent even using the app. Last night my roommate asked me where I got my runner rug, never did I search runner rugs, but yet the next morning Facebook is sending me runner rug ads! Facebook is a HUGE INVASION OF PRIVACY",2," User Story: Frustrated with constant harassment and censorship, the user seeks a more welcoming platform to express their opinions about country, politics, and religion without fear of consequences. They desire privacy protection from intrusive data collection practices like listening in on phone conversations or showing targeted ads based on private discussions (e.g., runner rug ads after offline conversation). In summary, the user is looking for an engaging social media platform that values and respects individual freedom of speech and personal privacy."
"Facebook uses their power to censor posts and hide commentsposts related to topics aka PALESTINE that go against their prozionist, terrorist loving narratives. They willingly hide our posts, prevent us from sharing, and will go so far to delete postsstoriescomments and blame it on a bug. The Zionism shows. The racism shows. The prochildren murder lovers shows. The antisemitism shows. Dont use this app. Youll be happier without it. 

Respect for Apple for shutting down your money hungry privacy stealing scam.",1," User Story: An individual is highly critical of Facebook's bias towards pro-Zionist narratives, which results in censorship and hiding of posts related to sensitive topics like PALESTINE. The platform allegedly manipulates post visibility, shares, and even deletes content under the guise of technical issues.

They strongly suggest avoiding usage of Facebook, commending Apple's action to curtail its intrusive behavior concerning money, privacy, and data theft."
My Facebook has been repeatedly hacked these past few weeks. Im convinced FB has something to do with it. Only way theyre allowing me to unlock my account is to send a full photo of my Government issued ID. Ughh no! Fb doesnt need my physical address and other info thats on my drivers license. What happened to email and text confirmations?? Out the door,2," User Story: The client has faced multiple Facebook hacking issues recently, raising suspicions about platform involvement. To regain access, they are required to share personal information from their Government ID, including address, which they find uncomfortable. They desire a more secure account recovery process, similar to email and text confirmations, that does not involve disclosing sensitive details from identity documents."
"Their updates have made it awkward to use. If you want to respond to a comment, you have to go out of the way to do so. The algorithm is poorly managed, theyll penalize you claiming it goes against their Community Standards when in reality, youve done nothing wrong. You cant get ahold of anyone to report any issues with the platform. It obviously politically motivated and biased, not too mention they wont stop bothering you about their personal agendas such as vaccination information that doesnt provide information at all. I wont recommend this app to anyone.",2," User Story: An individual is frustrated with a platform's recent updates as they make navigation and interaction (e.g., responding to comments) inconvenient. The user perceives the algorithm to be poorly managed, leading to unfair penalties for content that doesn't breach community guidelines. Communication with support is difficult, and there are concerns about political biases within the platform. Users find issues with how vaccination information is presented, lacking crucial details. As a result, they strongly discourage others from using this app."
FB will do anything they can to get all information on you and sell it. They make it impossibly difficult and confusing to change your privacy settings. Its laid out that way so most people especially the older crowd cant figure out. Much better social media apps out there. Use something else! FB is dead!!,2," User Story: The dissatisfied user expresses frustration with Facebook's complex and misleading privacy settings, designed in a confusing manner that makes it difficult for many users, particularly older individuals, to navigate effectively. They believe Facebook collects excessive personal data for the purpose of selling it to third parties. As an alternative, the user recommends exploring better social media apps on the market and suggests abandoning Facebook due to its perceived shortcomings."
"My phone contact list was stolen without my approval !!! 
My friend whos on my contact list bought a product and i was advertised the same product on the next day! Hows that possible if i never searched for such a product and my friend doesnt have a Facebook account! And I didnt even open my Facebook account or messenger for months!! Facebook is the only social app i have on my phone.

I fear this app is a spying tool on peoples privacy. 
Do Not Install this App.",2," User Story: An individual expresses concerns about their contact list security and unwanted product advertisements on Facebook, even when they didn't search for those products or actively use the app recently. They suspect Facebook of being a potential spying tool invading privacy and strongly advise against installing it."
It has become increasingly obvious that it is virtually impossible to use the FB app and not have them tracking everything you do even when the app isnt open and youre signed out. There is little doubt in my mind the CIA is directly involved with Zuckerberg and Facebook and it was developed specifically as a tool to track people and collect data.,2," User Story: The dissatisfied FB user perceives that the app invades privacy by tracking activities even when unsigned and the app is not in use. They hold suspicions of a collusion between CIA, Zuckerberg, and Facebook, viewing it as a platform primarily designed for surveillance and data collection purposes."

Also, there should be a way that we can pin important messages in groupchats on fb messenger.",2," User Story: The client expresses concern about Facebook collecting personal data and customizing ads, finding it intrusive. They request the option to disable this feature. Additionally, they suggest enhancing Facebook Messenger's functionality by allowing important group chat messages to be pinned for easier access and reference."
"Lots of crashes being reported, never got an respond back, and crushes still there. Lot of fake accounts sending spam, and none of them was deleted after reports. Always answer its not harmful. Yes, if someone follow their link and loose money and personal information, its not harmful for Facebook but their standards do not care about you. 
Last one I was banned about Kyle and court ruled that he did nothing wrong. But Facebook thinks different way, court no matter to Facebook representatives, they strike you for 7 days if you support different option than Facebook",1," User Story: The platform is experiencing frequent crashes without any responsive fixes or updates. Numerous fake accounts send spam messages that remain active despite reports, with the platform dismissing them as non-harmful. It prioritizes its own interests over users', unresponsively banning users (e.g., for supporting Kyle after a court ruling) and ignoring legal decisions that contradict their actions."
"Facebook used to be about community and sharing. All it is now is a glorified data miner for your data and they are making billions off of you. You give them your soul and they give your soul to others. 

Its become nothing more than mindless tv with advertisements everywhere. All eyes are on you and ears and location and likes and dislikes, etc. 

Facebook needs to be illegal. Its practices are.",2," User Story: The individual reminisces about Facebook's community-focused past and now perceives it as a data mining platform primarily generating revenue from users' personal information. They express frustration with excessive advertisements, privacy concerns regarding eye-tracking, location sharing, likes, and dislikes.

My profile was hacked about a month ago. My email and password were changed so I wasnt able to get back into it. I was notified by email that this happened and followed a link to prove my identity. I submitted my personal information to this link and waited for them to confirm. After 48 hours they confirmed my ID and sent me a new password and a link to follow. It did not work. I emailed Facebook security to tell them it wasnt working and have not received a response in a very long time. I have contacted them now 3 times by email. I still have not received a response. I wish there was a phone number I could call to expedite this process. I am extremely dissatisfied with their service. If I could give a rating of zero I would.,2," User Story: A user experienced account hacking on Facebook, leading to inaccessibility and the need to regain control through identity verification.

"Listen, I know we all know about cookies and how the entire Internet is selling our information for profit all the time, but Facebook is the worst for it.

Do yourself a favor and just get off Facebook.",2," User Story: An individual expresses strong dissatisfaction with Facebook due to severe lack of user privacy, the potential origin of widespread data selling practices, and accusations of racial bias in censorship. The user perceives the platform as unattractive, and has a negative opinion about its creator. They recommend others to discontinue using Facebook for their own benefit."
"Facebook has become the network of choice for the Democratic Socialist Party. They push an agenda of misinformation and only allow for just one side of a conversation. That one side is that of the Democratic Socialist Party. If the view is not in their, Facebook, best interest then they, Facebook, will censor those views. Facebook doesnt allow for a fair and equitable distribution of information so its members can make an informed decision on their own. If I couldve given a lower rating than 1 star I would have! So if you wish to have every post censored and even have ALL OF YOUR PRIVATE MESSAGES READ AND CENSORED. Then by all means download this tracking app and have your life made public! If you like being able to separate your public from private life get MeWe and Parlor apps!",1," User Story: The Democratic Socialist Party member is unhappy with Facebook's platform, as they perceive it to predominantly promote a single agenda and censor dissenting views. They believe Facebook limits the diversity of information, preventing users from making informed decisions independently. This user prefers alternative platforms such as MeWe and Parler that maintain privacy in personal messaging and offer a more balanced exchange of ideas."
Facebook turns people into products. They manipulate algorithms to spoon feed certain ideologies and to suppress others. All while making BILLIONS as they collect and sell every bit of personal information you provide. Youre literally just a human battery in the Matrix when you use Facebook. And free speech on the platform is highly suppressed. Theyre too busy catering to their woke agenda. Dont expect their alleged community standards team to be anything close to reasonable if youre not a full blown anarchy loving communist who hates America. It should be renamed community DOUBLE standards team. Youre better off deleting the app and watching how much better life can be when you dont have a 247 megaphone of actual disinformation doing everything that it can to control your perception of reality. Good luck and God bless. May the awakening continue...,2," User Story: An individual expresses dissatisfaction with Facebook, highlighting concerns about manipulative algorithms promoting specific ideologies, suppression of opposing views, and profiting from user data sales. They perceive an unbalanced approach to moderation and suggest that the platform should be renamed as it favors certain political beliefs. The user advocates for deletion of the app to escape misinformation and disruption of reality perception. They encourage others to experience the positive impact of detaching from Facebook, hoping the awareness continues to spread among users."
"The weak security allowed my account to be hacked. The Facebook folks that dont exist locked down my account and probably will elimininate by the account, just that there is no one to talk to they make no investigation and I end up loosing all my pictures, friends and memories saved there. They should have costumer service for more than d charge money to their customers. 

Not sure it is worth it to even download it",2," User Story: The individual expresses frustration with the website's inadequate security measures that led to an account hack. Consequentially, their account was mistakenly locked and potentially deactivated without proper investigation or communication from the platform. They emphasize the need for a responsive customer service system and question if using the site is still beneficial given these issues."
"I wouldnt want my information been sold and also Facebook doesnt check for fact checkers wether they are capable of judging without a biases. Its like 1 person researching all this information about everything which is too much for one person to handle.
I also think that suppression of information is and has been enforced which in itself is a violation of freedom speech.",1, User Story: The website should prioritize user privacy by not selling personal information and ensure unbiased judgment with a collaborative fact-checking system. Address the overload on individual fact-checkers by distributing responsibilities among multiple team members. Uphold the principle of freedom of speech by avoiding suppression or censorship of legitimate information.

Up until yesterday I was always able to edit posts I made on personal pages from my phone on the FB app.  Today cannot.

"I was hacked back in April, and lost 10 years of memories and pictures and everything and tried so hard to get back into my account and its impossible to communicate with anybody from Facebook.

They received a warning and found Facebook (FB) consumed 6GB data over 25 days, primarily due to the recently added Reels feature that appears to be preloading videos automatically.

All day it has been saying no internet connection and not posting on my story and not loading my timeline like Facebook has just completely crashed.
