"Ive been trying to get a hold of Facebook because I dont have access to my email but I have a phone number on my account but it wont send me confirmation to my number  all my other apps are logged in to my Facebook account big mistake when I try and get help it gives me things I can do but I did it and it still didnt help me, Facebook can you help me yet?",2,"As a Facebook user who has lost access to their email, I want the ability to recover my account using my registered phone number so that I can regain access to my profile and connected applications.

Currently, the platform's recovery process does not successfully send confirmation codes to my phone number, despite it being listed on my account.  I need a solution that allows me to verify my identity through alternative means and restore access to my Facebook account.

"Keep getting banned on Facebook for random things, like posting a video of my own daughter walking, and things taken out of context. Even when Facebook review and realise they made a mistake and admit to it and apologise they dont remove that data stored on you so your account is constantly harassed and silenced!! Wont be using it anymore. Im British at Facebook doesnt understand our humour, banter, context  its very annoying we used these apps to stay connected to family, for work, etc.",2,"As a user who wants to stay connected with family and use the platform for work, I need Facebook to accurately assess content and understand cultural nuances like British humor. Currently, I am frequently unfairly banned for innocent posts, even when Facebook acknowledges its mistakes. This persistent flagging and silencing hinders my ability to use the platform effectively.

"I have been locked out of my account for 2 weeks now after being hacked.  I have contacted Facebook via email relentlessly as Incan not access the help or report section of the platform.  This has caused me to be locked out of my Instagram account as well.
I use the platforms for my business.  My customers think that we have gone out of business.  I spent hours on the phone with my carrier and Apple thinking that something was wrong either with the phone or my carrier.  Its Facebook.   Short codes are coming in from everyone else except them, and they have yet to reply.",2,"As a user who relies on Facebook for business, I need a reliable way to recover my account after being hacked. Currently, I am unable to access the help or report section due to the lockout, preventing me from regaining access and causing significant damage to my business as customers believe we are closed.  I need a timely response to my support requests to resolve this issue.

"For all the good Meta does in keeping us connected your company, your leadership and enablers have hooked users to over sharing and over exposure.  In so doing this corporation parasitically intentionally feeds on our unconscious insecurities and shadow via algorithms.  This leads to profound suffering and loss of intimate connections.  This has been my experience.  I believe there deserves to be a class action lawsuit to hold FacebookMeta and its leadership accountability for the incredible political,  societal and individual harm their endless selfish greedy quest for power through data manipulation has wrought.",2,"As a user concerned about mental well-being, I want Meta to redesign its algorithms so they prioritize healthy online interactions and reduce oversharing.

This is because the current system encourages excessive exposure and exploits users' vulnerabilities, leading to feelings of inadequacy, strained relationships, and emotional distress.  I believe this algorithmic design contributes to widespread harm and should be addressed for the benefit of users.

"The site not only has bias on every topic, but they also dont allow the user any privacy.  They will also censor anything that they dont agree with by flashing it as false when in fact it is not false or by taking down your post.  This is very close to communistnazi behavior and is unacceptable in a free country.",2,"As a user concerned about freedom of expression, I want the ability to post content without censorship or fear of my account being penalized for expressing views that differ from the platform's own. I also need assurance that my data and online activity are treated with respect and privacy, rather than being used to unfairly influence my experience on the site. 
"
"Facebook is too woke and too much sensoring.   They track you, spy on you, and listen to your convos.  Not to mention the owner contributed millions to stealing election.  It was invented by CIA to watch us",1,"As a user concerned about privacy and censorship, I want to use a social media platform that doesn't track my activity, censor my posts, or engage in political manipulation. I need a platform where I can freely express myself without fear of surveillance or unfair content moderation.

"I can no longer see who liked my posts. Every time I click on anything it says, no data to show. Im getting unbelievably tired of the updates theyre doing. Im 100 about to go back to MySpace or just delete my Facebook account.",2,"As a user, I want to see who has liked my posts so I can engage with them. Currently, clicking on like lists shows ""no data to show,"" which is frustrating and makes me feel disconnected from my audience.  Frequent updates that break core functionalities are driving me away from the platform.

Its fine until I go to my profile to see view as and cant look at my pics. I want to be able to look at my pics while in view as because its easier to see what pics and videos of mine that complete strangers can see instead of going through all the pics and videos and changing their individual privacy settings. Can yall fix that please,2,"As a user, I want to be able to view my own pictures and videos within the ""view as"" profile feature. This would allow me to easily identify which media items are publicly visible to strangers without having to manually check and adjust individual privacy settings. Being able to see my content from a stranger's perspective would simplify privacy management.

"13 years I trusted this site with my life.. only to find out its a data collecting agent of China , pushing communism with its sensoring and false narratives. Big money BIG EVIL .. this app needs to be a mistake of the past.",2,"As a concerned user who has relied on this site for 13 years, I need the platform to be transparent about its data collection practices and affiliations. The current censorship and promotion of potentially biased narratives erode trust and raise concerns about hidden agendas.

"My 15 year old account got hacked and disabled with 2 factor identification on. Facebook reported to have made 116 billion dollars in 2022, but cant afford customer service. I cant recover my account because it was disabled. Facebook also took the liberty to disable my Instagram account. Both disabled with no review. I have never caused in issue on either apps going against there terms and agreements. But I learned a valuable lesson, you dont have any rights to your profiles, pictures, conversations, or business information etc, they can take it away and not give it back at any given time. I have spent many hours researching, sending emails, trying different things etc. to no avail. Thanks Facebook for the complete disappointment and for completely not caring about your customers.",2,"As a user with a 15-year-old account protected by two-factor authentication, I want to be able to recover my disabled Facebook and Instagram accounts without facing unreasonable barriers. This is crucial because my accounts contain valuable personal information, conversations, and business data that are important to me. The current lack of customer service options makes it impossible to resolve this issue, leaving me feeling powerless and frustrated.

"I like to delete andor hide almost everything I have previously seen from FB on a daily basis. Now FB is sending out more of their own garbage than I get from friends. Even though I have clearly requested NO memories, they keep sending more and more. Their reporting system is a waste of time. The buttons on anything they send you dont work and when used just eats up data for hours at a time. I am flooded with Suggested Pages, Friendverseries, Videos, etc and the buttons dont work. The more you report, the more they send.",2,"As a Facebook user, I want to be able to easily delete and hide past posts and activity so that my feed is primarily populated with content from friends. Currently, Facebook bombards me with unwanted ""memories,"" suggested pages, friend suggestions, and videos, even though I've explicitly requested not to see them. The reporting system for these unwanted items is ineffective, with buttons often failing to work and wasting data. 
"
"It is amazing that Facebook refuses to listen to those who want to use the app but find it a waste of time.  We know you make your money by ads, we could care less.  I have seen thousands of requests to allow users to set how they see their feed, most recent, all comments, etc. but you continue to shovel feed with comments most relevant a unique way to say we will only show you what we want you to see, top posts instead of all posts, again a way of censoring.  This truly is becoming the most inconvenient way of trying to communicate while being the biggest corporation spying on everyones action including what you do on the net that has nothing to do with Facebook.  Their trackers are monetizing every action you do.",2,"As a Facebook user, I want to be able to customize how my news feed is displayed, such as viewing posts in most recent order or seeing all comments, so that I can have more control over the content I see and avoid feeling like my experience is being manipulated by algorithms.

"This app has completely went downhill !!! NOT A LICK OF FREEDOM LEFT , THEY MONITOR ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFO EVEN WHEN APP ISNT BEING USED. If you try to change your own personal information, you cant until after 30 security questions then it still wont let you. BEYOND POLITICAL AND RACIST. Quick to flag people of color posts but let them be white they can say all the racists things on social media that they want !",2,"As a user concerned about privacy and freedom of expression, I want to be able to control my personal information and post freely without excessive monitoring or biased content moderation so that I can feel safe and respected on the platform.

"If you want your data stolen, download this app. If you want Facebook to spy on you, download this app. If you want your data sold, download this app. Constantly having to change settings so they do not have access to my camera, mic, contacts etc. after each update is just incredibly messed up. Download at your own risk! I will never get back on this app",2,"As a user concerned about privacy, I want the ability to control data access permissions without constantly having to readjust them after updates.  Currently, the app aggressively requests access to my camera, microphone, and contacts, making me feel like my data is not secure. This lack of control makes me hesitant to use the app. 
"
"Theyve changed the algorithms to make it more difficult for those trying to advertise their business. They censor what information theyd like you to receive.

"My Facebook page got hacked and its no way for me to retrieve it. The person took over my whole account. Every time I try to recover it, it goes to his information. He has tried to get money from my friends and he tells them that my son is sick. This is terrible and Facebook need to find a better way in recovering people page. Lori Allen was my Facebook page and now its a man up there. Very disappointed.",2,"As a Facebook user, I want a more secure account recovery process so that I can regain access to my hacked account, even when the hacker has changed personal information.

"I can create an avatar on Instagram and on one of my Facebook business pages but I still cant create one on my personal page where I would actually use it! Please for the love of God, fix this. My app is up to date and Im using an iPhone 12 Pro Max so it isnt my device or the app thats the problem.

"This app spread so much hate and evil. It destroyed families, friendships, relationships. It took jobs and spread racism, sexism, and immorality. It basically fathered all the other toxic apps like tiktok, bigo, and it eventually corrupted fun apps like instagram when it took over. We lost our privacy, we lost freedom and we lost our children in many ways. This app was the worst thing to happen to a global society. Its nothing like myspace was or yahoo which frankly pioneered social media but didnt get recognized for its stolen tech. The ceo allowed hate speech and fake news to destroy the dignity of government office. If less than 1 was possible I would give it",1,"As a concerned citizen, I want this platform to effectively moderate harmful content like hate speech, misinformation, and harassment because it is causing significant damage to individuals, relationships, and society as a whole. I believe that platforms have a responsibility to protect their users and promote healthy online interactions.

I need a more responsive support system that helps me regain control of my account and remove unauthorized access. 
"
Apple made it so permission is needed to track what I look at on other sites yet its pretty obvious youre not following this. I like what Facebook fundamentally stands for originally but its getting to the point where the constant tracking of everything I look at is getting old how about a reply from you explaining this!,2,"As a user concerned about privacy, I want Facebook to respect my device's Apple tracking permissions and refrain from tracking my browsing activity on other websites. This will help me feel more in control of my data and restore trust in the platform. I would appreciate a transparent explanation from Facebook regarding their data collection practices. 


"
I cant trust this company after hearing about the censoring and the personal info watching. I immediately deleted the app and deactivated my account.

"If I could give 0 zero stars I would or even negative 5 stars better. After being on FakeBook for 13 years and not once being put in FakeMo jail, I ended up in jail 1 week before the 2020 Election because I supported DJT our true President. I never went back and will never go back. Im done being censored or told what to thinksay. Im a true Patriot and Constitutional Conservative, I refuse to be tracked by anyone. Im telling you conservatives that Telegram is there for you. We have everything and more with that great app. As far as Messenger? Theres an app for that too. Its Signal and it is encrypted, safe and private. I can keep track of all my family and friends. Please LEAVE FakeBook Twitter and IG!

No tracking, no selling your data. Disable Google and all their cookies!",2,"As a conservative patriot concerned about censorship and privacy, I want to be able to freely express my political views online without fear of being silenced or having my data tracked.

"This is without a doubt the worst social media app available. Its losing subscribers at an alarming rate. They spy on you even when your phone is off they are listening.They track your habits and attempt to influence the way you think, what you buy, and even how you vote. Their mind control tactics are synchronized in conjunction with Google and Twitter. So if youre really interested in going full AOC communist I recommend you get the whole package.",2,"As a user concerned about privacy and autonomy, I want this social media app to stop tracking my habits, influencing my thoughts and decisions, and potentially listening to me even when my phone is off.  I believe these practices are unethical and violate my trust. I also want transparency regarding any data sharing with other platforms like Google and Twitter.

"The fact that they allow photos of my kids out float out there without my permission is absolutely horrendous. The photos are not from any family members. They are school pictures that allow name labeling without our permission.

Facebook will sell your data to the next highest bidder. Run away from this app.",2,"As a parent, I want control over which photos of my children are shared on Facebook and who can label them, so I can protect my children's privacy and prevent their images from being used without my consent.

Facebook lies Facebook sells your data Facebook manipulates people by show them false information that fits there agenda but when you actually give out real facts and real studys they ban you for false information or dangerous individuals all facebook does is brainwash the masses and take away our rights. Facebook thinks they are so powerful they can do whatever they want like take away your first amendment rights of freedom of speech because it doesnt fit the narrative Facebook doesnt let you participate in the second amendment you try to show anything related to the second amendment and your banned for violence. Facebook is a evil communist controlled ap used  to takeaway our rights alone with Instagram and Twitter none of them allow the truth to be told all of them want world control,2,"As a user concerned about freedom of expression, I want Facebook to stop censoring content that contradicts its own agenda and allow for open discussion on topics like the Second Amendment. 

I also want Facebook to be transparent about its data collection practices and ensure my privacy is protected. Currently, I feel manipulated by biased information and fear being unfairly banned for expressing dissenting views.

One star should be self explanatory after the data breach with no notification from Facebook. Even with changing the privacy settings Im still getting personalized adds even with the settings changed. Only on here until something better comes along.,2,"As a concerned Facebook user, I want to feel secure and in control of my data.

Because the recent data breach lacked any notification, and despite adjusting privacy settings, I am still receiving targeted ads, indicating ongoing privacy violations.

"Ive had an account for 13 years and spent thousands in advertising. I have memories on my personal account from people who are no longer alive. My account was hacked and the hackers posted something bad. I even have proof that I was unable to access my account that day. still, Facebook is going to delete my entire account because there is no way to disagree with this decision. The feature is broken. No one answers emails and the whole site is a big advertising piece of junk now.",2,"As a long-time user who has invested significantly in Facebook advertising and cherishes irreplaceable memories, I need a reliable account recovery process that allows me to dispute false accusations and regain access to my account.  

Currently, the system automatically deletes accounts based on reports without providing users a chance to defend themselves, leading to the irreversible loss of valuable data and connections.

"I rarely to never use this app because of how outdated it is. Facebook as a corporate is garbage, they sensor free speech and fight against human rights advocates. I also loathe them for their data collection policy. Deleting this app.",2,"As a user concerned about freedom of expression and data privacy, I want the app to be updated with features that promote open dialogue and transparent data practices so that I feel comfortable using it without feeling censored or exploited.

"Why is the Dark mode option not available whenever I switch from my personal profile to my Fan page profile? The white screen on my laptop burns my eyes, I have really sensitive eyes. It makes it difficult to manage my Fan pages due to this mess!",2,"As a user with sensitive eyes, I want the dark mode option to be consistently available across all profiles, including fan pages, so that I can reduce eye strain and comfortably manage my pages.

"Facebook tracks users of google to websites they visit after doing searches evidenced by targeted ads which is an invasion of privacy.  Facebook censors users in various ways removing comments or posts claiming the user removed it when that is not a fact, fact checking opinions opinions are not facts, just users speaking their mind and Facebook doesnt like their opinions, giving warningsputting users in Facebook jail they cant post or comment for a specific period of time, if user disagrees time is extended or suspending users account, even not allowing users the ability to post scientific based evidence of specific topics that they dont like instead of letting users decide for themselves.  Facebook invades users privacy by using certain types of technology Apples Siri for example to listen into personal private conversations evidenced by extremely direct targeted ads that appear on users feed within hours of private conversation.  These ads are not related to anything the user has ever posted or commented about on Facebook, any other social media, or anywhere on the internet.  I or someone I personally know have had actually experienced each and every one of these issues with Facebook.  Apparently Facebook, specifically Mark Zuckerberg, believes he has every right to violate our rights, but we have no rights at all.",2,"As a user concerned about privacy and freedom of expression, I want Facebook to stop tracking my online activity after Google searches and using that data for targeted advertising because it feels invasive. I also want Facebook to stop censoring users by arbitrarily removing posts and comments, unfairly fact-checking opinions, issuing unjustified warnings and ""jail time,"" and suppressing evidence-based discussions on certain topics.  Finally, I want Facebook to cease using listening technology like Siri to collect personal information for targeted advertising purposes as it violates my privacy.

"Flagging words, and then auto labeling content as factcheck to be missing content or partially incorrect, does NOT make you look smart.  There is NO WAY you can fact check personal information like the death of family member and say it is wrong when you do not know the family member.  You also cant factcheck a meme or photo.  
The FACT is FB is biased and needs a whole new overhaul!",1,"As a user concerned about accuracy and bias, I want Facebook to stop automatically flagging personal content as potentially false. 

I need the platform to understand that not all information can be fact-checked, especially sensitive details like family deaths or subjective content like memes and photos. This current system feels invasive and dismissive of users' experiences.

"If you tipped Stalinburg upside down the entire CCP would fall out of his pocket. He employs CCP infiltrated staff to fact check and enforces fascism into his company standards by forcibly oppressing any opposition to his leftist, wokeracist, covidmaskvaxx worshipping ideologies. PS  Facebook isnt social media, its a data mining app that will be used against you in the future.",2,"As a user concerned about political bias and freedom of expression, I want Stalinburg's fact-checking practices to be transparent and unbiased, free from CCP influence, so I can trust the information presented on the platform and feel safe expressing my opinions without fear of oppression. 


**Explanation:**

This user story focuses on the core concerns raised in the review:

* **Political Bias:** The user explicitly mentions ""CCP infiltrated staff"" and ""leftist, wokeracist"" ideologies, indicating a perceived political bias.
* **Freedom of Expression:** The user feels ""forcibly oppressed"" for opposing Stalinburg's views, highlighting a concern about stifled dissent.
* **Transparency:** The user wants ""transparent"" fact-checking practices, implying a lack of trust in the current system.

The story avoids directly referencing inflammatory language and focuses on the user's desired outcome: a platform that is perceived as fair, unbiased, and open to diverse viewpoints.

Im giving Facebook one star because I cant leave them negative stars lol. Anyway Facebook is so easy to hack. I recently had my account hacked on 122521 and ever since then Ive been trying to reach the facebooks security team. Both by phone and email that is provided and no luck. Whoever stole my Facebook changed the email and everything no matter what I do I cant get it back. So like I said I tried to contact Facebook and no one seems to care. What was supposed to be a fun social media app has turned into a nightmare for me. I use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends far away from me and share pictures of our families. I have never violated any guidelines nor do I post inappropriate context for this to happen has ruined social media for me. I mean who hacks facebooks really its not like you got anything from me just a page with pictures and happy positive posts. But whatever.,2,"As a Facebook user who relies on the platform to connect with family and friends, I need Facebook to implement stronger security measures to prevent account hacking.

This lack of security has caused me significant distress and severed my connections with loved ones.

"Im in Facebook jail without due process. They cant show me where I violated COMMUNITY STANDARDS, so essentially you are at their mercy and all they do is use your data.

Account was hacked and quickly lockeddisabled. Managed to change password but unable to progress with account recovery as I cant receive any text codes from their system. Looked into contacting customer support.. literally nothing. Some kind of help desk FAQ that is useless.. no phone number or email. Found a number but only a useless robot that led to nothing. Looked and noticed its happening to hundreds.. and scammers are taking advantage or causing it in the first place to pose as customer support to naive consumers. Where they then ask for money or personal information for help. What a joke.,2,"As a user, I want to be able to recover my account after it's been hacked and locked, even if I can't receive text message codes. I need reliable customer support options like phone or email contact to assist me with this issue because the current FAQ and automated system are unhelpful.  The lack of accessible support leaves me vulnerable to scammers who impersonate customer service representatives.

"Been trying to log into my account, but cant because the phone number and email on it are listed on other accounts too. Thank god I can steal several others accounts instead of logging into my own due to lack of support. They offer it, but for businesses and ad purchasers only. Personal accounts get an FAQ style support that solves nothing and only offers rudimentary information based on your needs. Most of which isnt helpful at all.",2,"As a user with multiple accounts linked to the same phone number and email, I want to be able to easily recover my account through alternative verification methods, like security questions or a linked social media profile. Currently, I can only access support through a limited FAQ which doesn't address my specific issue.  I need reliable customer support accessible to all users, regardless of their account type, to resolve login problems effectively.

Its really annoying...I cant use my personal real account...where I have given every proof that facebook community need...than why my account is being disabled??? I recommend everyone not to use facebook...such a bad experience with their new meta...,2,"As a Facebook user, I want to be able to access my account using my real identity because I've already provided the necessary verification.  The repeated disabling of my account despite verification is frustrating and makes me question the reliability of the platform.

"All the censorship, political and otherwise is despicable.  This program was founded in America but it was founded on the most unAmerican ideals possible.  They will scour and steal every bit of data about you, they will track everything you do, and everywhere you go and in return they will silence and censor your opinions.  They may as well attempt direct enslavement as it is clear they want nothing more than absolute control.  Pathetic, and disgusting behavior unbecoming of the civilized world.",1,"As a user concerned about online freedom, I want the ability to express my opinions freely without censorship or fear of data exploitation.

"I hate that there is no one to talk to. My account was hacked after having it for 11 years and they changed my recovery email but anytime I sent in my IDs to add a new recovery email it said the information did not match the info on the account you mean the account that someone else probably changed by now!? You mean the thousands of photos dont match my drivers license or any of the past posts?? Like why dont you let me answer my security questions or ask me questions about my account to PROVE that its mine!! I was also told it would be deleted in 30 days if not claimed. I was sad. It relieved because I dont want some stranger to have all of that! And yet its still up.. Ive reported it, had other friends report it. Blocked it. Still upset because that had so many photos and good memories that I cant see anymore. Seriously there has to be more ways to recover an account or someone to talk to please!!",2,"As a long-time user with valuable memories stored on the platform,

"With every update it gets worse and worse!!! Why update if it gets worse? Do you even test the app before releasing an update? Seriously like come on! For those in charge of pressuring the developers to release updates to meet demand is absolutely wrong and have no regard to releasing an unfinished or untested update. Marketplace messages is an absolute mess, Facebook searches gives me random results not remotely close to what Im searching and recommending randoms that dont pertain or have no relevance to me. I understand needing advertising for profit but this is ridiculous. Way to sell out! Settings are an absolute nightmare to use and changes made are not shown aside from daily surprises of new features that no one wants! Fix the current problems first and then come up with new features smh. Please reevaluate priorities. I hope devs see this. Supremely disappointed!",2,"As a user, I am frustrated with the frequent updates that worsen the app's functionality.

I need the marketplace messages to be improved for easier communication. Facebook searches should return relevant results instead of random suggestions. The abundance of irrelevant advertising is also a major concern.

"Facebook doesnt care about their users. They refuse to reinstate chronological timelines, filter out friends you dont interact with enough and actively create echo chambers. App is more concerned about pushing Facebook agenda than allowing free thought. Privacy is not a priority.

opening facebook kills my background audio
no dark mode on ipad not a bug, just a complaint

"The app is trash. Not only is it violently unstable, riddled with bugs, and dark mode still broken after weeks, it gargles resources for lunch and chugs battery life.

Oh and it gives Facebook yet another way to invasively track you, creeping into your phones permissions and invasively gathering website data even when you dont use the app. Turning off this setting requires around nine clicks, I counted. And you have to reset turning off that setting after a major app update or it just turns itself back on.

And Facebook is one of the worst companies in the world. Humanity is their commodity and they buy and sell your online identity. Delete the app and delete your account.",2,"As a user concerned about privacy and device performance, I want the app to be stable and bug-free so I can trust it to function reliably.

"My account was hacked and the support line was absolutely no help whatsoever.

I now have to completely delete the app when logging out. It will not disconnect. Ever. The circular symbol keeps spinning. It will not let me disconnect.

Facebook generates its incomprehensibly massive revenue off of the account holders. The account holders own the personal data within the account.

It has become increasingly obvious that it is virtually impossible to use the FB app and not have them tracking everything you do even when the app isnt open and youre signed out.

I know it was my fault but I wasnt thinking ! Its so easy for someone to scam you and then try and scam your family and friends ! Facebook doesnt care either unless you buy an oculus ! I cant get back into my Facebook and my friends are saying this person that took over my Facebook is begging for money. Facebook is horrible ! They collect your data and dont care about you .,2,"As a Facebook user, I want to be able to easily recover my account if it's compromised so that scammers can't impersonate me and exploit my friends and family for financial gain.

"Facebook deleted an account that was hacked that I owned for 15 years. Multiple attempts to deactivate have left with nothing because there is NOTHING you can do. And since you are not paying for the app they dont care. Everyone who has ever used this app knows that they make money off of you one way or another. But for me, 15 years of memories, 2 biz pages and an IG account hacked and gone no content I ever posted is in any group or community. Its theft of ideas, memories relationships because they choose not to help. Then they blame the lack of customer service in covid. It is sad how intertwined we have become with this format and yet they have no responsibility in what they have created.",1,"As a user who has relied on Facebook for 15 years, I want the platform to offer robust account recovery options, even for hacked accounts, so that I can regain access to my personal memories, business pages, and connections without losing valuable content and relationships.

This level of control feels invasive and undermines the company's claims of protecting user data.

Facebook is silencing people and deleting their post. Their loyalty was never to their customers. The privacy is something to be concerned with. As well as if you would like to write and spread awareness about a humanitarian issue think agian before using Facebook. Because theyll delete your posts if the government told them to.,2,"As a user concerned about freedom of expression, I want Facebook to stop deleting posts on political or humanitarian issues without clear justification. This is because I believe social media platforms should protect users' right to share information and raise awareness, even if it challenges powerful entities. The current practice erodes trust and makes me feel unsafe expressing my opinions freely.

Facebook blocked me from marketing my legal businesses. They have censored free speech. They violate your privacy and sell your data . Some even say it's a CIA operative.

**Additional Notes:**

This user story highlights the user's frustration with Facebook's policies regarding advertising for legal businesses. It also touches on concerns about privacy and data collection, which are important considerations for any online platform."

I really wish family was not on this app so I could get rid of it. The fact that my oculus needs a profile to be used is  stupid. The day Valve releases a standalone VR headset Im jumping ship.

We are people.,1,"As a VR user, I want the ability to opt-out of family features on my Oculus profile so that I can have a more personalized and private experience. Currently, the requirement to have a profile linked to Facebook/Meta feels intrusive and limits my control over my data.  I would appreciate greater transparency from Meta regarding their data practices and community guidelines to build trust with users.

This app is awful but thats besides the point. Your information is being sold to the highest bidder and then used against you. Will never use Facebook again.

Freedom is not just an idea. This app was supposed to be our town square. It has become something evil and ugly where the truth is hidden and lies are promoted.

Read all the privacy and agreements hidden ones too and they steal all your info and sell it. The make it extremely difficult for someone to research what they do with your info.

Havent logged on in at least a month. One day the app decided it needed to verify my identity. But when I type in my password it asks me to generate my own code somehow. From what the internet says I need access to the account to use its code generator why it doesnt send a code to my phone to verify is something I dont understand. Greatest thing about Facebook is the complete lack of support. Sell our data all day and night cant even get support for more complex issues it just really shows how much the company DOES NOT CARE.,1,"As a user who hasn't logged in for a while, I want to be able to easily verify my identity when prompted by the app. 

Currently, the verification process requires me to generate a code, which I can only do if I already have access to my account. This is confusing and frustrating because it seems like a basic security feature, sending a code to my phone, should be available. The lack of support options for this issue further exacerbates my frustration.

I would be having a conversation about something and minutes later theres an add about it on my news feed. How can this be legal for them to creep on your conversations??? Its so intrusive. Also why am I not allowed to remove my last name on there? What if Im Concerned about my privacy? You have little to no control what you can do on fb. Why does the cover photo have to be made public so your stalkers can see whos liking your photo? I will be deleting this ASAP and sticking with FaceTime if I want to stay in touch with family.

Very frustrating. Facebook used to be a place to stay connected with old friendsdistant family etc. now its just adds and poorly managed accounts. Theres no real way to filter out hateful content or other that you dislike.

Horrible experience.,2,"As a user wanting to connect with friends and family, I'm frustrated by Facebook's overwhelming focus on ads and lack of control over the content I see.

"I logged out of my Facebook account just now. My login information was not saved whatsoever. I can click on my profile picture to login but since I forgot my password, Facebook has me search up my phone number or email address to find my account why????. Note that I have my email address and phone number in this account already. When I search my for my profile with my email and also tried my phone number , it says no accounts match that information.

"Facebook is an evil globalist spy entity engaged in outright social engineering and manipulation of the wordwide population. 

With more power than any of the early 20th century monopolies, Facebook is the manifestation of an OrwellianHuxleyesque dystopic nightmare that infects and afflicts and subverts humanity and all core values of freedom of speech and association, individual rights, privacy, etc. 

This is a demonic bastardization of all of the good that this technology could provide. 

All involved should be ashamed... AND IN PRISON.",2,"As a user concerned about privacy and ethical data practices, I want Facebook to be more transparent about its data collection and usage policies so I can make informed decisions about my online activity.

"In July I got hacked , Facebook notified me via email but it was 3am when it happened so I was asleep. When I woke up an found that it had. I hurried and tried to do everything to get it secured. It was to late. I was able to get my email changed back in the account but the hacker enabled 2 factor authentication and change my phone number so I am stuck. Locked out of my account. So now I cannot even log into my account. I have reached out to Facebook for 4 months straight trying to get them to respond is to no luck. I have submitted my drivers license ID 80 times with the same response of we need an acceptable form of ID. IT IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM , its the first one that you can select when submitting it.

Zero customer service. I worked on my business page for 5 years and was hacked on my personal account and lost complete access to my business page. I had to create a new business page, and facebook wont even let me create a new one! It just keep saying query error. Absolutely disgusting that a company is allowed to have absolutely zero customer service, no live support chat, no phone number, no one to respond to emails, nothing. Honestly I cant wait for a better platform to come out and put facebook in the ground. Or someone who knows what theyre doing to take over facebook and make necessary changes.",2,"As a small business owner, I need reliable customer support from Facebook when encountering issues like account hacking. Currently, Facebook's lack of live chat, phone support, or email responsiveness prevents me from regaining access to my business page after being hacked, forcing me to create a new one and facing ""query errors"" in the process. This experience makes me desire a more supportive platform for managing my online business presence.

"Why are other people allowed to share MY postphoto but I cant see it because of THEIR privacy settings? How does that make any sense when its my content to begin with? How do I know Im not being bashed or made fun of?! If someone shares my stuff, I should be able to see it. Period. Also, if you want people to use Reels more professionally make it so we can choose our own cover photo for the reel cause the ones you all choose are awful. And almost all of my reels are muted with copyright claims. I chose songs from the available library you all have for your users using the Audio function. Why is this happening?! Update this, please! Can we be more uptodate like TikTok and Instagram? I mean, dont yall own Instagram? Come on now. The reels for Facebook is such an outdated editing feature. Oh, and thank you! I do love Facebook.",2,"As a user who shares content on Facebook, I want to be able to see my posts when they are shared by others, even if the sharer has privacy settings, so that I can monitor how my content is being used and protect myself from potential harassment. Additionally, I want the ability to choose custom cover photos for my Reels and have copyright claims addressed for music selected from Facebook's own audio library, so that I can create more professional and engaging content.

"So many glitches and the advertising is completely out of control. They are already stealing all of our personal information in exchange for using their app, and now they are harassing us with ads every 1 to 2 posts. Ridiculous.",2,"As a user, I want the app to be more stable with fewer glitches so that I can have a smooth experience.  I also want to see significantly reduced advertising frequency as the current level feels intrusive and excessive. My privacy is important, and I shouldn't be bombarded with ads every few posts.

"My account was cloned even after setting up two party authentication and changing password to an impossible to guess series of letters, numbers, and symbols. Settings for privacy and notifications dont work, so I shouldnt be surprised. A myriad of problems with this app, plus the fact its owned by an evil communist.",2,"As a concerned user, I want my account to be secure even with two-factor authentication enabled, so I can trust the platform with my personal information and feel safe from unauthorized access.  

Additionally, I expect privacy and notification settings to function correctly, allowing me to control my online experience.

"After the election results I left Facebook app. permanently. They sold our information, spied on our private messages, censored conservative voices, interfered in our elections. Im sick that after many years of supporting them they betrayed us conservatives. I cant support this app anymore. Im out.",2,"As a conservative user who values privacy and free speech,

I want to be able to connect with others and share my political views without fear of censorship or data misuse. 

Facebook's actions have eroded my trust, leading me to seek alternative platforms that prioritize user autonomy and ethical practices.

"My account has been hacked and my identity has been compromised. I have tried to contact Facebook as for help and they continue to empower the HACKER!!

The hacker has stolen my identity and changed emails and phone numbers to steal money from family  friends!!!

Facebook has NOT helped and continues to provide access to the Hacker ",1,"As a concerned user, I need a reliable way to regain control of my hacked Facebook account because the current support system is not helping me recover my stolen identity or stop the hacker from further financial exploitation of my contacts.  I need Facebook to prioritize user security and provide effective assistance in recovering compromised accounts.
