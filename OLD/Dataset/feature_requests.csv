This app would be awesome if you could sync Fitbit data and would be so much more useful.,Samsung Health,feature_request

"I need the precentage of remaining battery of garmin instinct. If I don't have it in my watch, I hope I have it in this app",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Does not sync with Google Fit? Will be buying another brand next time if feature not added.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
It's slow and you need to click through many screens now to get daily stats. My Garmin forerunner 25 Bluetooth keeps dropping. Wasn't like this with my vivofit.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
It drives me nuts that the Last 7 Days calulation includes the current day. Makes it impossible to get a picture of what the actual average is as it isn't counting a full 7 days. Don't make me use an actual calculator Garmin!,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"The app works pretty well most of the time. It would be great if I could track data for different bicycles. Cycling defaults to one bike for road/MTB, and no option for e-MTB yet.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
All but a suggestion when cycling I may want to use 2 courses to create my own. Maybe you find a way to see more than one course on the screen.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Tries to open files associated with other apps. Garmin is clueless about how their app behaves. Very virus-like activity.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
I wish it had the pedometer in the notification bar,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Great app continuously improving. only thing I'd change is to have more training programs available for different distances, but I expect that's coming soon.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Does the job. But my floor count is so inaccurate the last 4 weeks. Vivosmart keeps saying I've climed 35+ floors everyday when its more like 10-15 floor.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Simple to use and consistently connects on first try. The app is good but should have a way for all devices to sum up their individual information in the app. That would be my only improvement.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Great data screens. Many features but find it hard to remember where to find them all.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Dislike the dark interface theme, settings are clumsy with too many menus. Regular sync issues, tech support useless, I was emailed instructions by the operator who appeared poorly trained.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"All functions work well. If the menu s were more intuitive, then it would rate 5 stars.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"A bit busy UI, but good functionality and stable on Oreo",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Great apps for tracking your healthy lifestyle. However it would be nice if i can connect to other calorie counter othet than myfitnesspal because my previous phone was having problem with mfp. Looking forward to use new features such as period & water tracker,Garmin Connect,feature_request
I would give five stars if you give me a easy way to sync with Google fit directly.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Can't login Connect IQ store with Google account. It's hilarious considering the Connect app suggests you to use itself for ease of connection to IQ store.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Most of the annoyances are gone. It's good again. Data is often slow to load but it works... Eventually.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Required making an account just to see if it was useful. Pass. Eventually made an account, my strap is not supported. Bleh.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Unusable unless you give Garmin all of your personal information. Also, this is at least the second, if not the third time I've posted a negative review here, yet my last review disappeared.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Good app. But it would be nice if I can choose my own totals in Actvities > Cycling > Totals... etc. Total climb instead of calories or distance. Thank you.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"How hard can it be to make the calibration in a treadmill activity count? Or the time? Or the steps? Everything seems ok in the device, but then it gets transferred to this app and everything is messed up!",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"There's a lot of content here to work with your Garmin devices. I think the interface can be a little clunky at times, but they allow you to customize it, too.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Beta UI for My Day tab looks great. I hope all tabs will improve soon.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
I now battle to sync my watch with my phone I have to disconnect and set up every time. why is there no pilates option on the app? kindly do an update for this,Garmin Connect,feature_request
My Garmin connect is excellent only thing is it should also check out the heart rate monitor with the watch!,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Best graphic display I've seen out of all the fitness apps, just lacking the option of seeing the detailed stats of your friends on the apps even if your friends wanted to allow you. I think you can't see stats either via website.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Great for viewing stats on completed activities. Shame it lacks route planning capabilities or ability to import gpx track - have to use garmin  baeecamp and a USB cable to create new courses.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Would be 5 stars, but you can't see the training programmes that you're currently doing, it only offers you to start new ones. I have to log in on a browser to see my training session each day.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Is there an option to be informed when I should drink something? In order not to dehydrate and to achieve your daily goal.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Very user friendly, easy to understand, and insightful. The only downfall is at times I have to edit my sleep stats. Besides that, so far I love it!",Garmin Connect,feature_request
would like to see an upgrade on the iQ apps. I use a lot for biking. don't like the fact that it doesn't stop the clock when I stop at a light,Garmin Connect,feature_request
The interface is very good but I wish VO2 was easier to view or more obviously presented,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Great device, poorly designed app! I want to see a Snapshot of my Heart Rate!  To many screens with useless data & I can't view or organize the data that I care about.  Get new software programmers, fire the current ones!",Garmin Connect,feature_request
No Goals? Stats: Should calculate best 5km even if done inside a 6km run. Widget/shortcut to add weight? No way to see/download waypoints saved on watch.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
A very handy app but occasionally it's slow to connect to my device.  I recently changed from a Nokia mobile phone which is not fully supported to an android device which is. I recommend this app.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Great app, wish that there were more detailed tutorials on watch models and uses",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Great interface... But because there are so many options it can get a little hard to navigate,Garmin Connect,feature_request
I would love to have the option to see the active minutes of my daily activities displayed below the calories under my day screen. Great app getting better at every update!,Garmin Connect,feature_request
I don't like the fact that I cannot track my food directly in the app. I couldn't get it to connect to mfp so I just use my Samsung health app for that and this app for steps and sleep.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Great app with lots of data! My only concern is the time it takes to update the app from my watch.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Other than not accurately counting flights of (house) stairs it works great. Wish there was a way to name ""other"" activities and not just other other 1 other 2 ect.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"would be better if the recorded activities showed whether you are working in thezone or not, rather than average heart rate.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Only thing I would like added is battery life in app,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Too many updates and too difficult to navigate to basic stats. Garmin software developers are missing the mark. Provide a lite-version without so many unwanted features or allow more customization to remove all the surplfuous junk. No longer updates after sync up. This occurs even after rebooting forerunner & phone.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Garmin is not very informative about what changed with new version. Would love to get the ability to create own activity type. In summer Im doing Rollski which not listed at all.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Very good application. Everything is alright except navigating back to main page/my day page. Also finding some settings i.e. recording smart/par min is difficult. Make setting simple . It will be awesome.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Great functions. Navigation for the app could be better. Don't like that I need to close and re-open the app to get back to main menu screens after traversing through certain functions.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Used to be great but the latest UI is horrendous,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Pretty good, but some things could be improved eg increase functionality to match the web / PC capability such as download gpx files (for people who do not have a PC); show temperature to one decimal place",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Would like to hide golf as I do not play it. But overall very good,Garmin Connect,feature_request
I am using huawei p30 pro and pair with garmin 945 music. This app drains battery and sometimes not easy to connect. Hope this app can sync better and efficient.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Works great with z5 and my forerunner 230. No issues with connection between the two at all. Sometimes sleep tracking can be a little inaccurate but not by much. There has never been a problem syncing with strava, can't comment on mapmyfitness unfortunately as I don't use it yet.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Keeps insisting on permissions to my calendar. No reason or explanation given...,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Can you set the alarm on the venu to not activate if no hr is being detected. Caught the watch alarming while charging? Also a snooze feature would be highly appreciated. Otherwise great hardware and software,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Awesome app, but I wish it let you make events for your group on the app and let you add your steps to your gear tracking.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"On one phone I can record in St and lbs,  not on one plus 3 though,  should be really simple in theory.  Linking to targets on the main garmin account would be be beneficial.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Works flawlessly, only issue is slow to upload rides. 10-15 mins after ride",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Great app, just wish i could edit and add things in",Garmin Connect,feature_request
This version is very efficient...  Works as expected...  Please add ElliptiGo activity on it....,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Streamline Activity Monitoring ... But The Connect is a well organised activity monitoring app, with encouraging reports. But I have one question: Why the app cannot display anything including a map in landscape mode?",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Sleep tracking requires improvement. Does not track rem or Awake periods accurately.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"The app is nice, well-designed and intuitive. I just wish it didn't require location services. I have a weather app that works just fine. Sleep tracking is great, heart monitoring is great. Some of the graphs (like the calorie tracker) could use some tweaking. Overall, excellent app.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"useful application, however it would be more useful if it can sync with Google fit",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Amazing features. Great UI. Usable However I don't understand why they don't let you compare 2 activities (e.g. 2 runs) to each other.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
All Good but Pls add Inbuild function to add food Intake,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"would be amazing if a feature/switch were added so that newly installed apps didn't automatically send smart notifications from the get-go. otherwise a good app, its just that one flaw.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Would be helpful if it synced with more fitness apps like MapMyWalk and Echelon. Also hard to figure out how to maintain connection to phone to keep certain watch data up to date, like weather.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
It would be 5-star if I could record a session just by using the app on my phone....for those times when I don't have my trusty Garmin on hand,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"One issue that i have is with connectivity between my phone and device. Sometimes the floors climbed are not accurate, it would be nice if the phone counted as well as the device. other than that issue i think the app is great",Garmin Connect,feature_request
periodically have trouble with syncing if there was a manual entry feature this would not be as problem also need some way to do custom reporting. I love the watch and now record information from the watch in another app in order to better track my overall performance,Garmin Connect,feature_request
10 runs. I'm IT dim. Still learning. Wish quick start had clearer instructions. Docked a star for that. Have lost one recording. Pressed wrong key on watch. But coping and very impressed.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Very good app but doesnt display VO2max all the time even though it should.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Since the latest update, the sync is permanent. Remove it please... I don't use the app everyday. Thank you",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Getting better and faster ... Keep it up.   Adding 7 minutes workout kind of activities with sample will be great feature.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Pretty comprehensive with it's data. The data screens are all well presented and easy to read. The app itself can be a little odd to navigate, but once you've sorted it out, it's not too bad.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Overall, I like the app but I would prefer it having a white background and sometimes i have to look around for certain stuff. Maybe I need more time to get used to it and learn it.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Vivoactive HR - works well, just wish it synced with Google fit.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Please see the Fitbit app for an example of a well-designed fitness tracking app.  This app is overly complicated and doesn't show me the basic info I want.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"You can't export your own data to perform your own analysis. The device's measurement uncertainty is also not stated anywhere, meaning it's measurements possess no meaning. You also can't control when SpO2 is continuously monitored.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Notifications does not work with Huawei P20. One day works, after does not. P.S battery optimisations etc things of course are disabled for this app. :-( Hard reset of the phone, OS upgrades, app reinstall, repairing does not help, next day same issue.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Great app for giving simple but really useful information following a fitness session for future Improvements.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Latest update does not show calories burned.  Could be 4 or 5 stars with just a few tweaks.  I do love the heart rate chart and other detailed workout info though.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"New home screen is really good. The only improvement is a widget for daily activity or the likes for andriod, makes the data collected a bit worthless sometimes if you can't just see it at a glance. Other products are far better at this.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Why is the vivoactive 4 no longer tracking sleep? It seems the update has removed functionality & I've only just bought it!,Garmin Connect,feature_request
works great but can you add zumba to the activity ,Garmin Connect,feature_request
It is basic.. But doesn't remind for logging foods or starting an activity. Also should give weight loss tips and advice for each day..like noom coach,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Guys a bit more love please! VivoActive 4 user. Please add Racing Kayak, it's an Olympics discipline after all. You r clearly not worth it one . Happy to change if you reply. Thanks.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Seems to have improved slightly. When will you support other calorie counters? I'm unwilling to use UA products due to their sponsorship of hunting.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Best fitness tracker I've used. The only thing I miss from other apps I've used is a chart that tells you how often you cleared your move allert through the day. Other than that I love it.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"In most ways it's really good but sometimes takes a while to load, otherwise it's great and tracks pretty much everything I want",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Love most features just wish menstrual cycle data was easier to input.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
My greatest complaints are the weather does not update unless forced by turning the weather display off then on again and it does not register naps vs sleeping. Otherwise it is a great app for my vivosmart hr+.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
smooth sailing so far. I like that my current running pace is shown but would like to see average pace too? If possible. Otherwise awesome app,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Very good. Only complaint is there are still some stats and view on the connect website that aren't available on this app.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"I say that i like it, i would love it if it would have the option of Zumba or dance.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Overall quite a good app but needs to be a little easier to access the settings section...,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"The app works well, whilst I'd like it to more data avenues for extrapolation and the integration of apps could be easier. I feel this is reliable and competent app.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
great and reliable app. never have any isses with pairing or bugs in the software. would be better if there were more watch apps in the store but thats about it,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Please add for Clock Alerts also Hourly tone option, not only til Sunset and sunrise. It is strange to don't have such simple and often option for so smart watches. Many thanks in advace.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Not very responsive, no animations, kinda slow. Design is not uniform. Settings menus are old, not a lot of custom options",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Works very well. Changing my review from being very close to 5 stars to just 2. The newest update that removed the total by calendar month is horrible. Please bring it back. Don't like it at all.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
No issues for me and more features than I'm currently using! Only recommendation I would make is the ability to assign body weight to an exercise in post workout editing if the app doesn't automatically detect that the exercise is a body weight exercise. You can only assign numbers.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
It's a nice app.. can be improved by making it work in standalone mode also.. i.e without internet connection and upload data when internet is available,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Works really well but could do with a more consistent experience with the landing page,Garmin Connect,feature_request
"Excellent for cycling, wizh it had greater flexibility in logging strength workouts, unable to write in different exercises",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"The garmin device is inaccurate and unreliable. It cannot measure distance and step count accurately. The app on the other hand, is useful for keeping track of your activities. If you want a fitness device, I would look elsewhere.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"The sleep app shows the most recent nights sleep on the dashboard display, but when you click on the details in will only show you the night prior and not the most recent night. Should be a simple update.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"It's good but not a clean modern interface. It's certainly NOT intuitive at all. So it's functional but drab, dated and boring.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"update: congrats, you did it. it's the first app i actually turned notifications off!!! original: why do you need 'read call logs' permission? and why app is so persistent about that?",Garmin Connect,feature_request
"The app is one of the best trackers out there on the market. My only complaint is the smart scale options. I understand manually entering someone's weight but need the option to manually input body fat, skeletal muscle mass, bone mass, and body water.",Garmin Connect,feature_request
Like the app but wish it has a bit more functions such as changing alarm time and some setting so I do not need to log into website to do that.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Constantly asking for permissions it does not need. No option to turn it off beside stopping it in android altogether.,Garmin Connect,feature_request
Awesome! Totally love the app. A couple of small things i would love to have the option to change ex deleting gholf! But otherwise totally love it! Great way to keep track of the effort i'm putting in!,Garmin Connect,feature_request
why there are no widgets for this app.....where the hell is battery percentage...developer might have thought they are useless....quite annoying and also dissapointed with this app,Garmin Connect,feature_request
