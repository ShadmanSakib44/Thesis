"In addition to being notorious for it39s privacy preaching tactics, selling users data to advertising agencies, Facebook continues it39s downfall into degeneracy by silencing and censoring voices that oppose what39s currently happening in Palestine. freegaza",1
"Ive been trying to get a hold of Facebook because I dont have access to my email but I have a phone number on my account but it wont send me confirmation to my number  all my other apps are logged in to my Facebook account big mistake when I try and get help it gives me things I can do but I did it and it still didnt help me, Facebook can you help me yet?",2
"Keep getting banned on Facebook for random things, like posting a video of my own daughter walking, and things taken out of context. Even when Facebook review and realise they made a mistake and admit to it and apologise they dont remove that data stored on you so your account is constantly harassed and silenced!! Wont be using it anymore. Im British at Facebook doesnt understand our humour, banter, context  its very annoying we used these apps to stay connected to family, for work, etc.",2
"I have been locked out of my account for 2 weeks now after being hacked.  I have contacted Facebook via email relentlessly as Incan not access the help or report section of the platform.  This has caused me to be locked out of my Instagram account as well.
I use the platforms for my business.  My customers think that we have gone out of business.  I spent hours on the phone with my carrier and Apple thinking that something was wrong either with the phone or my carrier.  Its Facebook.   Short codes are coming in from everyone else except them, and they have yet to reply.",2
"For all the good Meta does in keeping us connected your company, your leadership and enablers have hooked users to over sharing and over exposure.  In so doing this corporation parasitically intentionally feeds on our unconscious insecurities and shadow via algorithms.  This leads to profound suffering and loss of intimate connections.  This has been my experience.  I believe there deserves to be a class action lawsuit to hold FacebookMeta and its leadership accountability for the incredible political,  societal and individual harm their endless selfish greedy quest for power through data manipulation has wrought.",2
"The site not only has bias on every topic, but they also dont allow the user any privacy.  They will also censor anything that they dont agree with by flashing it as false when in fact it is not false or by taking down your post.  This is very close to communistnazi behavior and is unacceptable in a free country.",2
"Facebook is too woke and too much sensoring.   They track you, spy on you, and listen to your convos.  Not to mention the owner contributed millions to stealing election.  It was invented by CIA to watch us",1
"I can no longer see who liked my posts. Every time I click on anything it says, no data to show. Im getting unbelievably tired of the updates theyre doing. Im 100 about to go back to MySpace or just delete my Facebook account.",2
"they monitor EVERYTHING and god forbid they dont agree with you. posts get deleted, they suspend you just about anything. its like a virtual parent that constantly grounds you. i dont even wanna know what they do with my private information.",2
Its fine until I go to my profile to see view as and cant look at my pics. I want to be able to look at my pics while in view as because its easier to see what pics and videos of mine that complete strangers can see instead of going through all the pics and videos and changing their individual privacy settings. Can yall fix that please,2
"13 years I trusted this site with my life.. only to find out its a data collecting agent of China , pushing communism with its sensoring and false narratives. Big money BIG EVIL .. this app needs to be a mistake of the past.",2
"My 15 year old account got hacked and disabled with 2 factor identification on. Facebook reported to have made 116 billion dollars in 2022, but cant afford customer service. I cant recover my account because it was disabled. Facebook also took the liberty to disable my Instagram account. Both disabled with no review. I have never caused in issue on either apps going against there terms and agreements. But I learned a valuable lesson, you dont have any rights to your profiles, pictures, conversations, or business information etc, they can take it away and not give it back at any given time. I have spent many hours researching, sending emails, trying different things etc. to no avail. Thanks Facebook for the complete disappointment and for completely not caring about your customers.",2
"I like to delete andor hide almost everything I have previously seen from FB on a daily basis. Now FB is sending out more of their own garbage than I get from friends. Even though I have clearly requested NO memories, they keep sending more and more. Their reporting system is a waste of time. The buttons on anything they send you dont work and when used just eats up data for hours at a time. I am flooded with Suggested Pages, Friendverseries, Videos, etc and the buttons dont work. The more you report, the more they send.",2
"It is amazing that Facebook refuses to listen to those who want to use the app but find it a waste of time.  We know you make your money by ads, we could care less.  I have seen thousands of requests to allow users to set how they see their feed, most recent, all comments, etc. but you continue to shovel feed with comments most relevant a unique way to say we will only show you what we want you to see, top posts instead of all posts, again a way of censoring.  This truly is becoming the most inconvenient way of trying to communicate while being the biggest corporation spying on everyones action including what you do on the net that has nothing to do with Facebook.  Their trackers are monetizing every action you do.",2
"This app has completely went downhill !!! NOT A LICK OF FREEDOM LEFT , THEY MONITOR ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFO EVEN WHEN APP ISNT BEING USED. If you try to change your own personal information, you cant until after 30 security questions then it still wont let you. BEYOND POLITICAL AND RACIST. Quick to flag people of color posts but let them be white they can say all the racists things on social media that they want !",2
Ive had the same Facebook since 2009 somebody hacked me I can I want to go to my page theres so many photos and memories on that page business accounts and now I have no access to get in there I no longer use that email address and cannot change the password somebody hacked into my stuff tonight somebody please point me in the right direction,2
"If you want your data stolen, download this app. If you want Facebook to spy on you, download this app. If you want your data sold, download this app. Constantly having to change settings so they do not have access to my camera, mic, contacts etc. after each update is just incredibly messed up. Download at your own risk! I will never get back on this app",2
"Theyve changed the algorithms to make it more difficult for those trying to advertise their business. They censor what information theyd like you to receive. They track every piece of your existence and collect every ounce of information about you, your usage etc. They also access your microphone anytime they see fit.",2
"My Facebook page got hacked and its no way for me to retrieve it. The person took over my whole account. Every time I try to recover it, it goes to his information. He has tried to get money from my friends and he tells them that my son is sick. This is terrible and Facebook need to find a better way in recovering people page. Lori Allen was my Facebook page and now its a man up there. Very disappointed.",2
"I can create an avatar on Instagram and on one of my Facebook business pages but I still cant create one on my personal page where I would actually use it! Please for the love of God, fix this. My app is up to date and Im using an iPhone 12 Pro Max so it isnt my device or the app thats the problem. I have even logged into my account on other peoples phones who have the avatar feature and it works for their account but not mine. What the heck, Facebook?!",2
"This app spread so much hate and evil. It destroyed families, friendships, relationships. It took jobs and spread racism, sexism, and immorality. It basically fathered all the other toxic apps like tiktok, bigo, and it eventually corrupted fun apps like instagram when it took over. We lost our privacy, we lost freedom and we lost our children in many ways. This app was the worst thing to happen to a global society. Its nothing like myspace was or yahoo which frankly pioneered social media but didnt get recognized for its stolen tech. The ceo allowed hate speech and fake news to destroy the dignity of government office. If less than 1 was possible I would give it",1
"So apparently I can report being hacked  and block that account but you do nothing ! My friends are sending me pictures of this woman who is showing up on my account and getting messages to borrow money!! Ive tried to recover my account to no avail ask fb for help with unhelpful responses cant say Ill be on much longer as soon as my friends get all my pictures recovered 

Thanks for nothing

Who use to be Bernice self till some troll had her killed off thats how good you are",2
Apple made it so permission is needed to track what I look at on other sites yet its pretty obvious youre not following this. I like what Facebook fundamentally stands for originally but its getting to the point where the constant tracking of everything I look at is getting old how about a reply from you explaining this!,2
I cant trust this company after hearing about the censoring and the personal info watching. I immediately deleted the app and deactivated my account. Im sure that wont stop anyone from obtaining my info but it sure makes me feel better knowing its not just out there. Regardless of what privacy settings you have on your account.,2
"If I could give 0 zero stars I would or even negative 5 stars better. After being on FakeBook for 13 years and not once being put in FakeMo jail, I ended up in jail 1 week before the 2020 Election because I supported DJT our true President. I never went back and will never go back. Im done being censored or told what to thinksay. Im a true Patriot and Constitutional Conservative, I refuse to be tracked by anyone. Im telling you conservatives that Telegram is there for you. We have everything and more with that great app. As far as Messenger? Theres an app for that too. Its Signal and it is encrypted, safe and private. I can keep track of all my family and friends. Please LEAVE FakeBook Twitter and IG! These apps are all tracking your purchases, marketing to you and influencing your political beliefs. DuckDuckGo is the best search engine and so is Presearch.org look into them! No tracking, no selling your data. Disable Google and all their cookies!",2
"This is without a doubt the worst social media app available. Its losing subscribers at an alarming rate. They spy on you even when your phone is off they are listening.They track your habits and attempt to influence the way you think, what you buy, and even how you vote. Their mind control tactics are synchronized in conjunction with Google and Twitter. So if youre really interested in going full AOC communist I recommend you get the whole package.",2
"The fact that they allow photos of my kids out float out there without my permission is absolutely horrendous. The photos are not from any family members. They are school pictures that allow name labeling without our permission.

Facebook will sell your data to the next highest bidder. Run away from this app.",2
Facebook lies Facebook sells your data Facebook manipulates people by show them false information that fits there agenda but when you actually give out real facts and real studys they ban you for false information or dangerous individuals all facebook does is brainwash the masses and take away our rights. Facebook thinks they are so powerful they can do whatever they want like take away your first amendment rights of freedom of speech because it doesnt fit the narrative Facebook doesnt let you participate in the second amendment you try to show anything related to the second amendment and your banned for violence. Facebook is a evil communist controlled ap used  to takeaway our rights alone with Instagram and Twitter none of them allow the truth to be told all of them want world control,2
One star should be self explanatory after the data breach with no notification from Facebook. Even with changing the privacy settings Im still getting personalized adds even with the settings changed. Only on here until something better comes along.,2
"Ive had an account for 13 years and spent thousands in advertising. I have memories on my personal account from people who are no longer alive. My account was hacked and the hackers posted something bad. I even have proof that I was unable to access my account that day. still, Facebook is going to delete my entire account because there is no way to disagree with this decision. The feature is broken. No one answers emails and the whole site is a big advertising piece of junk now.",2
"I rarely to never use this app because of how outdated it is. Facebook as a corporate is garbage, they sensor free speech and fight against human rights advocates. I also loathe them for their data collection policy. Deleting this app.",2
"Why is the Dark mode option not available whenever I switch from my personal profile to my Fan page profile? The white screen on my laptop burns my eyes, I have really sensitive eyes. It makes it difficult to manage my Fan pages due to this mess!",2
"Facebook tracks users of google to websites they visit after doing searches evidenced by targeted ads which is an invasion of privacy.  Facebook censors users in various ways removing comments or posts claiming the user removed it when that is not a fact, fact checking opinions opinions are not facts, just users speaking their mind and Facebook doesnt like their opinions, giving warningsputting users in Facebook jail they cant post or comment for a specific period of time, if user disagrees time is extended or suspending users account, even not allowing users the ability to post scientific based evidence of specific topics that they dont like instead of letting users decide for themselves.  Facebook invades users privacy by using certain types of technology Apples Siri for example to listen into personal private conversations evidenced by extremely direct targeted ads that appear on users feed within hours of private conversation.  These ads are not related to anything the user has ever posted or commented about on Facebook, any other social media, or anywhere on the internet.  I or someone I personally know have had actually experienced each and every one of these issues with Facebook.  Apparently Facebook, specifically Mark Zuckerberg, believes he has every right to violate our rights, but we have no rights at all.",2
"Flagging words, and then auto labeling content as factcheck to be missing content or partially incorrect, does NOT make you look smart.  There is NO WAY you can fact check personal information like the death of family member and say it is wrong when you do not know the family member.  You also cant factcheck a meme or photo.  
The FACT is FB is biased and needs a whole new overhaul!",1
"If you tipped Stalinburg upside down the entire CCP would fall out of his pocket. He employs CCP infiltrated staff to fact check and enforces fascism into his company standards by forcibly oppressing any opposition to his leftist, wokeracist, covidmaskvaxx worshipping ideologies. PS  Facebook isnt social media, its a data mining app that will be used against you in the future.",2
Im giving Facebook one star because I cant leave them negative stars lol. Anyway Facebook is so easy to hack. I recently had my account hacked on 122521 and ever since then Ive been trying to reach the facebooks security team. Both by phone and email that is provided and no luck. Whoever stole my Facebook changed the email and everything no matter what I do I cant get it back. So like I said I tried to contact Facebook and no one seems to care. What was supposed to be a fun social media app has turned into a nightmare for me. I use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends far away from me and share pictures of our families. I have never violated any guidelines nor do I post inappropriate context for this to happen has ruined social media for me. I mean who hacks facebooks really its not like you got anything from me just a page with pictures and happy positive posts. But whatever.,2
"Im in Facebook jail without due process. They cant show me where I violated COMMUNITY STANDARDS, so essentially you are at their mercy and all they do is use your data. I now refer to Facebook as HATEBOOK or RACEBOOK. Its an ugly place that BOTs are taking over. Hatebook is going away like AOL and YAHOO",2
Account was hacked and quickly lockeddisabled. Managed to change password but unable to progress with account recovery as I cant receive any text codes from their system. Looked into contacting customer support.. literally nothing. Some kind of help desk FAQ that is useless.. no phone number or email. Found a number but only a useless robot that led to nothing. Looked and noticed its happening to hundreds.. and scammers are taking advantage or causing it in the first place to pose as customer support to naive consumers. Where they then ask for money or personal information for help. What a joke.,2
"Gradually learn to hate your friends and family while earning money for a massive corporation all while receiving nothing in return. Block everyone and everything, give facebook no data, remove all personal information from facebook.",2
"Been trying to log into my account, but cant because the phone number and email on it are listed on other accounts too. Thank god I can steal several others accounts instead of logging into my own due to lack of support. They offer it, but for businesses and ad purchasers only. Personal accounts get an FAQ style support that solves nothing and only offers rudimentary information based on your needs. Most of which isnt helpful at all.",2
Its really annoying...I cant use my personal real account...where I have given every proof that facebook community need...than why my account is being disabled??? I recommend everyone not to use facebook...such a bad experience with their new meta...,2
Dark mode is missing from the App Settings and Privacy on the iPad Pro..why? It works without problem on my iPhoneit doesnt make sense. This seems to be an issue among many users and seems like it has been going on for some time now and has yet to be fixed. Please fix.,1
"All the censorship, political and otherwise is despicable.  This program was founded in America but it was founded on the most unAmerican ideals possible.  They will scour and steal every bit of data about you, they will track everything you do, and everywhere you go and in return they will silence and censor your opinions.  They may as well attempt direct enslavement as it is clear they want nothing more than absolute control.  Pathetic, and disgusting behavior unbecoming of the civilized world.",1
"I hate that there is no one to talk to. My account was hacked after having it for 11 years and they changed my recovery email but anytime I sent in my IDs to add a new recovery email it said the information did not match the info on the account you mean the account that someone else probably changed by now!? You mean the thousands of photos dont match my drivers license or any of the past posts?? Like why dont you let me answer my security questions or ask me questions about my account to PROVE that its mine!! I was also told it would be deleted in 30 days if not claimed. I was sad. It relieved because I dont want some stranger to have all of that! And yet its still up.. Ive reported it, had other friends report it. Blocked it. Still upset because that had so many photos and good memories that I cant see anymore. Seriously there has to be more ways to recover an account or someone to talk to please!!",2
"With every update it gets worse and worse!!! Why update if it gets worse? Do you even test the app before releasing an update? Seriously like come on! For those in charge of pressuring the developers to release updates to meet demand is absolutely wrong and have no regard to releasing an unfinished or untested update. Marketplace messages is an absolute mess, Facebook searches gives me random results not remotely close to what Im searching and recommending randoms that dont pertain or have no relevance to me. I understand needing advertising for profit but this is ridiculous. Way to sell out! Settings are an absolute nightmare to use and changes made are not shown aside from daily surprises of new features that no one wants! Fix the current problems first and then come up with new features smh. Please reevaluate priorities. I hope devs see this. Supremely disappointed!",2
"Dont you just love how a multibillion dollar company doesnt have any support or call center not like it would help, anyways.  

Ive found tons of bugs and ways to track who enters or hacks your account  but no one to address the issues and you lose photos of your mother who passed and birth photos and such you store on Facebook.

Ive tried again later like its been years later.  Funny how easy it is to track contacts these days .",2
"Facebook doesnt care about their users. They refuse to reinstate chronological timelines, filter out friends you dont interact with enough and actively create echo chambers. App is more concerned about pushing Facebook agenda than allowing free thought. Privacy is not a priority.

The app and website are politically immersed and actively encourage antiSemitic and antiIsrael messaging.",2
"I feel that I am unfairly being banned from Facebook and messenger. I was hacked and FB immediately blocked me and said I would probably be banned.    
I use Facebook to keep in touch with my children, grandchildren family and military friends all over the U.S.
 I only have one phone number and it has apparently been blocked as well
Can someone please be adult enough to let me know how I can access FB once again.
Grannie",2
"Has become a right wing propaganda machine fueled by profits. No real honest shut down of disinformation. Tracking information we do not want tracked. Instagram has become a market place and is full off bots with to many ads. 
SMH",2
"Ive been a member of Facebook since the death of my space . I was recently banned for posting something in Messenger in a private group of friends. They removed my accounts form messenger, Facebook and Instagram.  I lost everything. Because of their Community standards of spying on private chat groups . Lost all of my pictures from over a decade as well as logins to third party apps and mobile games  which I invested time and money .  Im Contacting my attorney . This is not the last Facebook will hear from me !",2
"Constantly mutes the voices of activists. No real system to challenge accusations of community standards violations, allows racism on its platform but blocks, warns and mutes the activists who point it out. Awful privacy violations and generally a crap service. 

If I could write this review and give zero stars I would.",1
"Ive noticed that when I post a status, I can no longer edit it after its posted that option is no longer available. So I cant fix an error or add a photo or change anything once its posted. This is ridiculous and annoying. I can still edit privacy, trash the post, archive it, but the edit post option is no longer there. Ugh. Why update the app if there are more glitches and nonsensical changes like removing an edit post option.",2
Looks like Facebook is tracking every move I make even though I stated and turned off all tracing and tracking procedure that telling me to do but still being tracked off Facebook even on safari they can trace every move I do. And there is no freedom of speech or an opinion all censored,2
"They spy on you Deny free speech Censor opinions, and facts. If you like having your Constitutional rights violated, your information being sold to third parties, liberal propaganda. Being monitored by over sensitive nazis then fascistbook is for you.",2
So I think its suspicious that whenever I have Facebook installed on my phone the apps that I use the most stop working. The zuck also made it so he can spy on what you search on other apps so he can sell your information. So it doesnt surprise me that he disables other apps so youre forced to use Facebook now that everyone else is leaving it.,2
"im guessing they have such a monopoly on social media that the company and developers have nearly no incentive to fix anything. ive had the same exact bugs persist across devices an major OS updates. 

ones I can recall atm that frustrate me to no end
video resets every time I rotate the screen
opening facebook kills my background audio
no dark mode on ipad not a bug, just a complaint

this company makes billions of the data we provide to them for free, the least they can do is make an app that freaking works well and have their developers on top of keeping the app a pleasant experience with minimal bugs. if you need to hire more developers, then do that",2
Is the app incredibly glitchy even though it really shouldnt be? Yes. Will Facebook steal all data they could possibly obtain and sell it without your consent? Yes. Will they pretend to be a quirky tech company from Cali while actually subverting democracy and monopolizing the internet? Yes. But what else are you gonna do? Find a social media company with integrity? I didnt think so.,2
Was scrolling through my news feed and all of a sudden it sends me a message saying I have to verify my personal info. It asks for a passcode that was sent to my phone only I never received a passcode. I am now locked out.,2
"I am so disappointed with Facebook! I never post anything controversial, yet my Facebook was disabled a little over a week ago and now I received an email that it has been permanently disabled! Ive lost all my pictures and videos. Ive also lost access and information to every app that was connected to Facebook. FYI, when you create accounts for other apps, dont use your Facebook account to log in to those.",2
"This app was okay in the beginning but has become a tyrant in the industry. Constantly gets hacked, sells our info, no privacy or security. My app has been on the fritz again all week causing me to miss business ad posts due to not even being able to see content on my profile. Super tired of Zuckerberg and his complicity in completely disregarding everything its users want. Cant wait for the next big thing to come out. Cause this one is definitely not it anymore!",2
I can only use my Facebook App as my business and can no longer get to my personal page. I am not happy about that. Facebook still works fine on my desktop and my laptop so it is definitely the app that is the problem,2
"I opened my account in 2008. I got a new phone and rye app said it could recognize my device. Wouldnt even accept my password. Sent them my license and picture holding the date and a video they requested. Its been 5 months and still no access to my account and no responses from facebook. Theyve since closed my account. I had all my dead fathers posts and photos on there. Im very upset and annoyed at Facebook. They say they try to protect your information yet they steal yours!!!

Also that censor anyone who doesnt align with their agenda. They cant be trusted.",2
"Far too many ads, which are completely irrelevant to me. One would think with data collection Facebook would at least, send me ads Im interested in. The Marketplace  is useless. Most of the groups are angry people searching for like minded individuals who will mimic their complaints. And, yes, some children are still posting their food. 

Bad app, very bad app.",2
"So is Apple! Now they make it so you have to use the apps and not the browsers, easier tracking and spying. Unfortunately so many things and people use FB and other crappy platforms that limit your use and spy on you. Our world is doomed because of this trash and for allowing it to continue you get reap what you sow.",1
This app is the worse. Its create with the porpoise of tracking you and see what or who you talk with. This type of app it should be often changing of developer and app platform to the people have a little bit mor me of privacy,2
"Its worst designed application with zero privacy consideration, randomly engineered app, Sad to say zuckerberg major part of life was on creating amp supporting childish app. Fking zuckerberg for creating many privacy damages.",1
My account was hacked and Facebook deleted it. I lost all the pictures I had of my child. Contacted Facebook and they did absolutely nothing despite the fact that the hacker private messaged me and made legitimate threats to me. Facebook didnt even respond to me.,1
"All you do is silence anyone who speaks against your FAILED narrative, and then badger people by shutting down their accounts which is their source of revenue. I think its time we shut off access to your source of revenue so you can see exactly how it feels! We are DONE letting you mine our data for free! Your dream of smart cities is about to be flushed down el toileto ",2
"I keep getting the same spam bots on my Facebook telling me Im the winner, Im reported it and Ive blocked every bot, its the same profile picture on each of the spam bots page. Also Ive been getting notifications from random garage sale groups Im not even apart of",2
"Pictures will not open also

Between the privacy violations, the unjust property theft of any and all content accessed, and now the biased, blatant sensorship Im DONE with Facebook! Uninstalled for good! Facebook has continually and increasingly pushed steps towards invading the users privacy and rights to speech for YEARS now with NOTHING being done to stop it and Im DONE. I wouldnt even be writing this if it werent for the fact that this app DESERVES far more poor ratings.",2
"Seriously Facebook. Your new changes just get worse and worse. Too many ads. Every time I log in, I just want to close it and deal with it later. And the ads are just useless, not even slightly interesting. I find myself spending less and less time on your platform. Stop trying to pretend you actually care about privacy or connecting people.",2
"How come we still can39t see our timeline on the iPad?!?!? This should be the most amazing app ever!

UPDATE This company makes me sad, I was hacked last night and there has been zero way to restore my account. The hackers quickly within an hour changed all my info and added a 3rd party two factor authentication code that prevents me from moving past it . Your company is protecting the hackers and do not care about the actual account holder. Please make this right.",2
"Facebook has lots of issues even for our safety at this point we are all thinking is mark suckerburgh really help our privacy or just sucking our privacy away by putting our global security at risk with problematic safety concerns 100 but Facebook needs to hear us out and not from mark Zuckerberg immature ideas and fixes to Facebooks interface, algorithms, updates, ect. so Im giving this app and website including Facebook Messenger a one star ",2
"This app is horrible. It gives you constant notifications, even when alerts are turned off. The privacy issues and constant spying are despicable. They always want you to enter your phone number and never stop asking. To top it all off you cant turn the green active dot off even if you select to leave it off.",2
Maybe stop infringing on peoples rights and if youre going to correct someone use factual information. This is the most politically biased crock of s i have ever seen in my life. Breaking every law in the books and then telling everyone else theyre wrong just because they dont think the same. Waste of time and they are selling your info anyway.,2
Please take off the people you may know that are always so present on everyones pages. Literally I dont need your help advertising friends friends on my page. Its an absolute invasion of privacy. I dont care to see these people I dont want to know them. Please make it stop.,2
How does a company this big not have a single person to contact about my account being hacked!!! The hacker has changed all of my log in information and help center is no help at all! I have had my account for over 15 years and my family and life is in that account! I need my account back!,2
"Was hacked a few ago and being trying to get my account back 
With no help from Facebook. Send infos that ask for still nothing ..they ask me for code generator I cant open my Facebook to get 
Anyone else has this issues ..??",2
"Ive gotten banned twice a month and I havent even used this app much to share my opinion like I used to. I got banned for sharing a motivational quote with a male chest showing working out followed by a ban for trying to sell a post pregnancy girdle. Its pathetic. Theres nothing you can do about it since you pay them with you private DATA, but have to accept their abuse without being able to appeal.",2
"This app and company engages in censorship and supports the Israeli governments war crimes and genocide. I am thoroughly disgusted by Facebook. This company has a total lack of morality. No surprise tho given that they sell our info, and their company founder cheated his cofounder out of millions ",1
I do remember better days for Facebook. A time when it acted as versatile tool that could both monitor the kids and look for a used garden tools. Now its political  advertising and old people looking to mingle. The groups of Facebook are gone. For some reason the green thumb group just vanished one day. The gymnastics parents group just vanished one day. Facebook is a washed up old data base much like digging through and old box of paperwork at your xwives house. Goodbye.,2
"Facebook be constantly spying on my google searches, censoring my post, censoring the post I see. They update the app constantly and then my preferences change and I get 30 notifications that arent relevant.",1
"My account just hacked by a unknown user and I tried to proof Im the real user by my passport but you guys said that doesnt help... if a passport cant proof my identity, then what can I do? You want my DNA or something? By the way, theres no customer help number that I could call. Now Facebook became a free information reference for any hackers right now? What a shame....",1
"They will go out of their way to silence anything  to benefit their personal political views, no freedom of speech here better platforms would be Tik tok . . I have had pictures and videos removed for no reason only because I stand in solidarity for human rights in Palestine and the owners of Facebook are 100 is really Zionist that oppose the movement and they will silence anyone who doesnt fit the narrative",2
"I can not log in to my account on the app because it claims I have no internet service, which is crap! I can do everything else on my phone! I also can not even access Facebooks page on Safari or Chrome! The pages literally will not open. I did everything suggested, still nothing!",2
"They take no accountability for the real life consequences of their inactions to moderate the content that is posted to the site. App endlessly plays mindless videos to mesmerize you into wasting time on the app. Its worse than watching TV.

FB threw a fit when Apple made changes to iOS that benefit their users privacy. I used to be skeptical of the people who said that Facebook is greedy and super unethical, but its fairly evident now that it may be true.",2
"Why is the editing button gone? It's our personal post, taking away to add or delete what we've said should be against your policy. You are making, what was thought a freedom of speech and the want to share with the public andor friends very hard to accept. Give us back the choice to edit our posts!!",2
I cant post a status or click on anyones profile without it saying error fetching data not only that fb will ban you if you breath the wrong way no freedom of speech what so ever if I could Id give them 5 star rating,2
My instagram has been hacked rather easily. the same account is linked to my facebook but for some reason i cannot unlink the instagram  which i no longer have access to from my facebook account which i do have access to. There are scams all over Facebook  instagram running wild even though with just a bit of tech support all these issues could be solved. How you a billionaire and cant fix minor issues like this?,2
"Ive gotten two consecutive 30 day bans over nothing and there is no recourse, no one to go to.  Ive had several friends get their business pages stolen and Facebook does nothing.  But they let scammers sell fraudulent products like million dollar watches for 100 which they never deliver just steal the money.  But god forbid you post anything about politics or COVID19 and theyll be all over you.  Facebook is run by crooks.",2
Im not downloading the app. and facebook decided to punish us by refusing to serve users with the same basic features that are apart of the app and desktop sites by removing them when using a mobile phone browser. 0 stars. Do not recommend. Horrible development,2
"I hate this app. All of the casual advertisements popping up after having a private conversation in person about it is a violation of my privacy. This app also silences conservatives, but has allowed sensually explicit spam videos on private community based pages, even after reporting with video and photo evidence. Pure trash.",1
"Facebook has a Broken 2 Factor Authentication System. My facebook has two different linked accounts. Unfortunately it doesnt have my mobile number linked so it made it even worse to recover my account. I recently got my i phone 8 replaced because the screen of my older phone broke completely which meant my phone still worked but the screen didnt which gave me no acess to the phone so i had to replace it to another i phone 8. Everything transfered smoothly from one phone to another. Except when i tried to log in it logged me in but facebook didnt recognize the browser of my brand new replacement phone and told me to use the authentication app which i didnt have access to. I have no other known browsers, u tried resetting my password just to be told i need a code from the facebook code generator but youd need access to your facebook account wich i dont have, facebook cant send me an SMS code because my mobile number isnt linked to it, i filled a report and since facebook doesnt have representatives or costumer service i have to wait an eternity. Im disappointed! I cant even log in with my email and i have two if them linked.",2
"My account was stolen from me yesterday, where they changed my phone number email and passwords. I never gave them permission to change anything. 

So if you cant get in, there is no way to access the help center. There is no phone number for customer support. 

All because a friends account was hacked? I had very few friends on this platform. Never befriended anyone I did not know. This program is unsafe and terrible. 

Even the police struggle to access them for support. No wonder people die. Shame on Facebook. This day and age, problems like this are unheard of. Worst programs ever.",2
Fakebook is a social platform set up by the see I A designed to track and monitor every thing you have ever posted and store all your information . They are co conspirers in the election fraud and they steal our rights to freedom of speach . They promote violence and lies and they suppress the truth . Fakebook is as fake as Bydon is prez.,2
"My account was hacked by someone who was on my friends list. A gift card was purchased using my account. Messages of fraudulent nature were sent to several friends. On top of this, several accounts in my name were created. And I could not edit or change my data. My name has been used to message me! Facebook. You are on your way out if you cant respond and act on reports that jeopardize my privacy!",2
"Facebook Policy only works for them in order to get more stronger, I think they should be neutral when it comes to human privacy and share the correct news data not misleading people on what they think right and not.",2
"My account was hacked and the help support page sent me in loop. Im unable to recover my account and one of my backup emails got spammed by the hacker. 

There is no live supportchat for this issue. Fortunately I had disconnected most of my apps that used Facebook. Unfortunately the hackers have my account some private information and access to my friends that started to receive spam as well.",2
"Somehow this apps advertising just happens to know exactly what Im talking about at all times, this includes live conversations. Ive talked about taking trips somewhere without ever inputting anything into my phone and VOILA! An advertisement about going to Hawaii after TALKING about it.",1
All the updates that you say to make the app better its a lie you take more control put more ads in and take more of my privacy away! It scares me when a friend post something and when I go to read it a popup comes up from what they posted using my name that the southern party should not know and asking me to join,2
"If I could rate 000, I would, FakeBook! FB has become a part of the swamp! You have suppressed our freedom of speech by fact checking every data posted that does not agree with your personal political select! You have censored everyone that does not agree with your political agenda! Joe Biden is not the president elect according to the US constitution which you have failed to acknowledge. Yall dont get to appoint a president elect! The electoral college system does! BTW, President Trump is still the sitting president!",2
"My Facebook account has been hacked and I have tried EVERYTHING in my power to contact support to get it back up and working for ME! Ive emailed multiple people. Tried to call some numbers I found, did the Facebook.comhacked and it just keeps putting me in circles. 
I have very important information on my Facebook for my business account and I cant even get into anything anymore.

I have tried to send in a form of ID and once I did they were able to update my account to the correct email but they stupidly forgot to take the hacked email off and didnt make mine the primary email so the hacker kept getting the password reset emails and kept just changing the passwords because I would even get any emails to do so..

Facebook support is trash! 

If you ever have any issue they will NOT HELP YOU! 
And now that All the Business information I have is out there thanks to Facebook not being secure enough or help at all , I lost everything. And I am STILL trying to get it back.. so if Facebook support sees this.. I really would appreciate it if you would help me for once! 

Thanks!",2
DEACTIVATED MY ACCOUNT ALMOST A DECADE AGO TO FIND SOME ONE HAS HACKED AND RESTARTED IT USING MY POHOTOS AND NAME TO FORWARD THEIR AGENDA AND FACEBOOK REFUSES TO HELP!!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT COULD RUIN YOUR LIFE!!!!! FACEBOOK IS A SCAM!!!  RUN!!!!,2
"The title summarises the feel of been subject to an arbitrary system, dystopic while inefficient, including continuous breaks of personal privacy. All by Facebook. Really takes a lot of work to become this bad, and it should not be allowed to operate in the public realm as a company. Apple should reconsider allowing this app in their system.",2
"If you want your privacy invaded in every possible way, download this app. They asked for my drivers license, and blatantly stated in the app stores description that theyll have access to EVERYTHING in your media devices database. 

Beware!!!!",2
"Facebook is no longer safe in any way! Dont put up pictures because they are now property of Facebook and you no longer have rights even a picture of your own child. 
Any information is sold about you to whoever wants to pay or it. 
COMPLETE SECURITY BREACH!!!",2
Sick of their lies and hiding information that the users deserve to know. They have been stealing and using our information for years IMO illegally and I have finally had enough and deleted their app. They have zero right to hush one side of any information unless it is truly dangerous to another person like a threat. Unbelievable. Its time they are shut down! Life is a lot less stressful without this fake site playing the man above.,2
"Used Facebook for over 12 years and was using it as a mom to keep up with friends and share memories. Then, someone hacked my account at 2am so I wasnt able to respond to the emails about the changes to my account. They changed the email to the account and the password. Facebook has no help chat or a person you can talk to about your account  you are all on your own. So now some horrible hacker has access to pictures and videos of my kids. 
I know the owner of Meta has children, he should be deeply ashamed of his app, its security measures, and its nonexistent help for its users.",2
"Whats the point of FB now? 

To track everything you do. Read their AUP and Privacy settings. If you even have this app on an iPhone it tracks and records you using your phone camera even when the app isnt open. 

I kept using the app until the censorship kicked in. This is an evil company. They hide truth but they will be exposed, Light always wins.",2
"Overly fast gifs, limited access to privacy settings unless you go on the browser, constant badgering to update personal information, offensive and unvetted sponsored ads, and no ability to troubleshoot technical problems with an actual human.",2
My account was hacked and I have and my fiends have tried to contact Facebook to fix and resolved the issue. The sad part is they are using my name and h information saying that I am selling dogs and they are taking innocent peoples money. This is just heart breaking and sad. No one has contacted me as I keep sending emails to the security team. I have had this account for so long I didnt ever think I could or would go through something like this. Just a shame,2
Your censorship on people and posts that are giving information about vaccines andor is rather disappointing. People can choose for themselves to read or move along. You should not be censoring peoples personal stories on the information being shared.,2
For the past three days I cant access any of my seller information or sales or shipping orders or anything on the Facebook app the only way I can use marketplace is on a browser  I use marketplace more than I do Facebook !?!!,2
"Facebook is nothing but a communists tool used to control information. Banning people, making things like female roommate preferred illegal to use, choosing what and what not to ban or promote. Zuckerberg is an evil person. Facebook tracks your every move! You have no privacy, and they sell the data they collect on you to control you some more.",2
"Private companies are not exempt from the Constitution! The first amendment states Congress shall make no law abridging it so how does you suppose you can sensor information you don39t like?
I have deleted this spy app and am never to reuse it!
I will dance the day your offices close",2
Why does Facebook requestrequire a government ID?  And in the fine print suggest they share info for up to 30 days with trusted partners.  I deleted my data and this app 5 years ago and returned only for the marketplace.  So much for that!,2
"The platform now is not allowing me to update my profile picture from the ones I already have.   

Know what you are getting into, no personal info to be input, FB will sell it. Robotic censorship for the little guy, yet allows gross misinformation for the ones who pay.",2
"Whatever theyve done has totally messed up ability to easily update Pages other than my Personal page.  This means I cant help with my volunteer jobs, as before.  Very sad to see something Launched without first TESTING it.  One day, things work easily next day were told account is disabled.",2
"The FBMeta platform doesnt create goodwill towards the community.  Instead, privacy breakdowns and lack of transparency to its valued assets, people, are not followed.  This issue is across their entire product line.  They havent proven themselves as trustworthy and dont make themselves accountable internally.",2
"I was hacked, FB app ask me to change my password, which I did. Then it said I wasnt old enough to have a Facebook, Ive had my acct longer than the minimum age. Two days later I get an email requesting my age verification documents, which I sent. Been more than 4 months, still no access! Cant contact them in anyway, horrible customer service!",2
My account was hacked and there is literally ZERO way of contacting Facebook about all of my information being taken etc. its been several days now and nothing. I even tried to make a new account and I cant even do that. I get an error message every single time.,2
"Facebook is becoming granny app type of thing, if I can give zero, I would. Their privacy setting is horrible and they try to keep it alive by trying to connect it to other apps. Facebook as a company will be on the decline, sooner that Later no morals or principals. Hope Apple will be ready to fill the void.",1
"Facebook is terrible. Fact checkers fact check everything, even if its a video and they do say whatever the fact checkers say they are not doing. Censorship is terrible. And the privacy settings are dangerous.",2
All the updates that you say to make the app better its a lie you take more control put more ads in and take more of my privacy away! It scares me when a friend post something and when I go to read it a popup comes up from what they posted using my name that the southern party should not know and asking me to join! Did it weeks ago its review and its still happening liar liar pants on fire and theyre getting away with it,2
"they keep deleting my review because it calls them out on their bigotry. how dare i tell the truth, right? facebook has an option to report hate speech but ALL reported hate speech doesnt go against their community standards. they also do nothing about spam and do NOT protect your privacy. 

facebook, ill leave this TRUTHFUL review as often as i need to. stop trying to save face. theres a reason you went from 4.5 stars to 2.2 stars in just a month.",2
"Ever wondered how advertisers know what youre thinking about? Well, thats because they actively listen to you. Yep. You read that right. The microphone access you give both of these companies work seamlessly together to piece a profile catered specifically to your preferences. They analyze what you say and then pump that into your feed. Its sick. Targeted advertising shouldnt be a clause in some vague terms amp conditions nobody ever reads. On top of that they censor everything and anything that challenges their constituents over at Washington. Im serious, this platform has been compromised for a while. I dont use Facebook at all except for when I need to call someone. Everything else will just dumb you down, like its already been proven to do so.",2
"Facebook app is completely invasive to your personalprivate life. You are better off logging on through your web browser. The app is like giving up all privacy and Mark Zuckerburg is a liar, thief and crook.",2
Facebook is starting to get flooded with scammers. At least 10 of my friends were scammed. Then the scammers with the persons page to scam someone else for money. Meaning if you had a personal convo with your friend the scammer has access to everything you said.,2
Found spyware Im pretty familiar with hacking .. its Chinese and its in everybodys Facebook .. was curious if I was the only one so I hacked multiple accounts .. Facebook is allowing China to access every Americans information even if Facebook app is uninstalled the spyware remains on your device .. just a warning before I expose Zuckerberg,2
I dont like the censoring they impose. I dont like the updates that deviously steal personal data to pad their profits. I also dont like how theyve turned their facial recognitiontagging into something to be used against us.,2
"Interesting how even after doing everything in the Facebook settings to eliminate sponsored posts, I start seeing ads on the app within hours of using a navigation app, opening a YouTube link from Facebook, or even just searching for a place on Google and just putting in a general area instead of allowing it to use my location. The ask app not to track pop up is purely cosmetic and the fact that it does it anyway is clearly a violation of Apples terms.",2
"I recently took a trip to Europe and made about 4 posts and 1 live video. Days later all of the sudden my posts were deleted even on some that people are tagged in. The photos are shown in my photos but my posts were deleted from my profile page. However, you can see the posts in the profile of the people who were tagged except my profile. I get notifications of comments and likes of the posts I just cant see it if I click on the post notification. I have to goto the people who were tagged in order for me to see my own post! The live video remained on my profile page. This is a personal account by the way.",1
"Ive had no access through the app for months now, Ive re set my password, I cant go on messenger or anything  guys please . Help .. I just want to send funny stuff to my old grandpa who refuses to use her phone number, Im tired of endlessly fighting against this loop of errors",1
"Im always reporting scammers, accounts with nudity pics, fake accounts and false information. You fools never take down the accounts or limit the accounts for going against community standards. If I post a screenshot of the accounts with nudity informing my friends of the scammer page my shi is the one to go against community standards. One day you all will be YouTube pop pop with the Glock Glock.

I removed the app and I am not getting back on data abuse book.",2
"Facebook is actively suppressing points of view they do not agree with or that dont meet there agenda which is a direct violation of the 1st amendment.  They also make billions selling your personal data, while they actively indoctrinate you.  This app is the cause of a lot of the worlds issues.  Why do people who helped create it not use it and forbid their children from doing the same.",1
"Fakebook is SO CORRUPT, they REFUSE TO DO THE SLIGHTEST THING TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS.

That GRIFTER, ZUCKERBERG, didnt even INVENT Facebook!
DARPA DID it as LIFELOG.
Its a U.S. Government PsyOp to gather and collate YOUR PERSONAL AND PRIVATE DATA.

I KNOW ITS YUGE, BUT USE IT AT YOUR PERIL!",2
"This used to be a platform to connect and share but it is clear now that the algorithm is also disruptive with constant unnecessary ads and invasion of privacy. The censorship is dystopian in every sense now so what is the point of sharing even factual information from a credible source?  I wouldnt even rate this a one star, its just that bad.",2
"Useless app! Got tired of censorship, fake news and self appointed fact checkers that make sure lies and deep state agenda rein. So I decided to down load all of MY data and go through their throughly numerous steps to completely delete my account. Done!... not so fast, my wife on FB tells me Im still on there, active months later. Facebook is using my identity. Run away from this app, it is pure evil.",1
"Ive been on FB ever since it was released I love the new features theyve added over the years, not a fan of them selling peoples data amp information.... but now some features on the iPhone app dont work anymore...marketplace doesnt work, it just shows a blank screen. Then when you message someone from marketplace, your chats dont show up in messenger....its really annoying. You have to find the market place post then click See conversation. Thats the only way you can see the chats",2
"Blatantly tries to steal your user data to seek for a profit. Im not saying other websites dont do the same, but Facebook goes farther and acts more entitled than any other groupcompany I can think of.",2
"im a new upcoming artist and i posted one of my songs on facebook and i tagged like 30 people in it.  Facebook decided that im not me and someones using my account, so they locked it. i couldnt log myself back in cause i no longer have access to that number. when i. clicked on try another way, the only way is by number. no email. nothing. i tried all night. still cant get in it.",1
"From selling our info, to tricking us, lying to us, and manipulating what we see and say, Facebook has done nothing to protect their customers.  The platform is a joke.  Remember the commercials they made apologizing to us after they made billions off our data??? Facebook will get what it deserves one day.",2
"Obviously it goes without saying the sketchyness of this company in my opinion, most notably the censoring and biasing of information. My stories would get flagged all the time because it didnt agree with them haha. Wouldnt recommend or use this app or any of its products at all.",2
"Besides the annoying repetitive ads, major major major privacy invasion! Why would you want Fb to see your offline activity? Sounds psychotic to me! They can see everything outside the usage of app such as all private conversations, calls, bank apps, etc. It is a NO for me, mind boggling to say the least.",2
"Anyone who thinks that FB is our public square is sadly mistaken. FB is boosting and deboosting content based on an agenda  theyre just using us. Delete the app and stop letting them make themselves rich off of harvested data!!! Enter via a browser, with FB blockers if you must",2
"The app is trash. Not only is it violently unstable, riddled with bugs, and dark mode still broken after weeks, it gargles resources for lunch and chugs battery life.

Oh and it gives Facebook yet another way to invasively track you, creeping into your phones permissions and invasively gathering website data even when you dont use the app. Turning off this setting requires around nine clicks, I counted. And you have to reset turning off that setting after a major app update or it just turns itself back on.

And Facebook is one of the worst companies in the world. Humanity is their commodity and they buy and sell your online identity. Delete the app and delete your account.",2
I have been a facebook customer for several years and recently had my account hacked. I have reached out so many times to have this corrected without result. I have decided that it is a poor application especially given that they can take your information and do whatever they want with it!,2
"you are no longer able to restrict profiles eventhough the option is there if you jump through enough hoops, BUT you get an error when you try to add someone to the list. It used to be simply on the persons profile just as ""remove friend"" is. Next we will be unable to remove friends and unable to delete accounts with error messages for each. Just a shame Going back to MYSPACE!!!",1
"My account was hacked and the support line was absolutely no help whatsoever. I was accused of posting something against their standards of child sexual exploitation and unable to get access back to my account. Lost over 10 years of photos and memories. To top it off, I created a new Facebook and after 1 day theyve prohibited me from liking, commenting, or posting.",2
From their censorship to their use of your private information Facebook is an echo chamber of whatever they want you to hear. Repeatedly blocking and censoring anything that doesnt fit their agenda. What a joke! byefacebook,2
Its been 2 weeks and I am STILL not getting notifications when someone posts on my personal posts. I am also not getting notifications from my business page now either until I actually switch over. Garbage app. Please fix!!,2
"They havent changed much when it comes to privacy, anyone can still share your pics. They dont prevent online bullying. They let people manage local groups that dont even live in the target area. There is no customer support so dont bother trying to reach out to anyone because there is no one to reach out to. I tried to think of something positive I could say about Facebook but nothing comes to mind its just a waste of time. And I also believe that Facebook starts conflicts because they think your value is based on how many likes you get in life just to make you feel inadequate. I cant tell you how many times Ive deleted this stupid app thinking itd be different or better in some way after two years but nope Facebook still does one thing thats consistent, disappoint.",1
Someone hacked my account and changed all of the log in criteria. When I followed facebooks recovery steps which included submitting a copy of my photo ID I was told they still couldnt verify my identity so my account was basically just gone forever.,2
"I reported that my account was hacked no one helped. Might as well shutdown Facebook for not helping people like me with our accounts that are being hacked. And people using our photos on other accounts, and using our personal info. even when our pages are on private. ",2
"Looks like the app doesnt recognize my current password when Im prompted to login again to access my account info.  And Im hesitant to logout of the app completely and back in again to try to reset this for fear Ill be locked out of the app until this bug is fixed!

FYI, I did change my password via the website a few months ago, so the app may be recognizing the old password.",2
"I have had this facebook account for 14 years with loads of memories on it. I have been hacked for the last 3 months and the person changed the email address, and added a code generator so that I would not be able to get access to it. I have submitted my ID 4 times with no success, and have tried to submit and report the issue, but every time it just tells me that it could not process my request. Facebook should have somewhere we can actually communicate with humans so this wouldnt be an issue. Wish I had access to all my memories.",2
Facebook is abusing its platform to silence and censor voices. Its unbelievable! Mark needs to go back to start and stop using his platform for his political agendas. Also protect peoples privacy instead of abusing it without their permissions.,2
For the second time as a member of Facebook my Facebook account had been hacked!!!! I have received Facebook messages from over 40 friends about the hack but I am unable to see what the hack says.  I am one of the moderators for a Facebook Page entitled Huntsville Standard Poodles and cannot even access that site!!!,2
Fact checkers are not real.  They are lying and covering up actual information.   Just because the news doesnt say its true doesnt mean its not true.  Facebook is a joke.  They spy on us and lie.  Delete this communistic loving crap app now!  Down with the fb!!!  Hello FBI,2
My account got hacked and it is so hard to contact someone from a tech support to help in anyway. I cant get my account back now because someone changed all of my information. I cant even redownload the Facebook app.,2
I now have to completely delete the app when logging out. It will not disconnect. Ever. The circular symbol keeps spinning. It will not let me disconnect. I believe it is either uploading or downloading data. I do not have trust. I simply delete the app every single time I use it. Then download the app again. And it is disconnected and opens fine but again I have to delete and redownload. This is very annoying and tedious.,2
As Facebook is phasing out human support and replacing them with bots this app basically harvests your info and sells it while restricting your account for posting Stewie Griffin memes. F   Dont even buy their metaverse crap gear. Terrible.,1
"Social media platforms, like Facebook, are poison to your mind. They sell your data and are building a digital profile of you, all the things you like, dislike, hope or wish for, and fear is in your digital profile. Not to mention this platform is designed to be addicting so that you keep coming back... Think about the last time that you opened Facebook. Did you make the conscious choice to do it, or are you just doing it by habit? Get off of Facebook and start living your life again.
1 year clean off of Facebook ",2
"The scrolling feature is acting really off the past couple of days. I even deleted the app and redownloaded it. I have the most up to date iOS. It scrolls whacky like you are being remotely hacked. The app isnt acting right. The FB app behaves like right as your phone dies things start acting delayed and reallllly slow or superrrrr sped up. . . That is how the scrolling feature is acting on the FB app, and nothing else on my phone behaves this way. It is just the FB app when you scroll in your news feed. 

FIX THIS!",2
Facebook generates its incomprehensibly massive revenue off of the account holders. The account holders own the personal data within the account. Common decency in business practice would uphold the priority of a strong symbiosis between the two. This is not the operating practice of this company. Unethical business practice is the dismal reality the account holders are left to face. And share holders are likely not far behind.,2
"Ive been getting error fetching data errors every 20 seconds. I cant even use the app anymore. Ive tried all trouble shooting options. My last profile was hacked and no one responded to my emails about it, so I assume Ill have to make another profile again if this error doesnt stop on its own.",1
"Facebook used to be cool then it went to trash as everyone realized its gov started and owned,then it helped the horrible outcome of our elections, and overall we all need to hop off it and goto FreeTalk45 for less policing and freedom to say what you want on your stuff. No biometric data needed. You shouldnt have to add personal Information to an app just to use it.",2
"Im tired of being harassed, silenced, put in timeout for having an opinion. Im tired of not being able to love my country, President. God. Im embarrassed Facebook is even part of America! Not to mention they stalk you, listen in on your phone when you arent even using the app. Last night my roommate asked me where I got my runner rug, never did I search runner rugs, but yet the next morning Facebook is sending me runner rug ads! Facebook is a HUGE INVASION OF PRIVACY",2
"Facebook uses their power to censor posts and hide commentsposts related to topics aka PALESTINE that go against their prozionist, terrorist loving narratives. They willingly hide our posts, prevent us from sharing, and will go so far to delete postsstoriescomments and blame it on a bug. The Zionism shows. The racism shows. The prochildren murder lovers shows. The antisemitism shows. Dont use this app. Youll be happier without it. 

Respect for Apple for shutting down your money hungry privacy stealing scam.",1
My Facebook has been repeatedly hacked these past few weeks. Im convinced FB has something to do with it. Only way theyre allowing me to unlock my account is to send a full photo of my Government issued ID. Ughh no! Fb doesnt need my physical address and other info thats on my drivers license. What happened to email and text confirmations?? Out the door,2
"Their updates have made it awkward to use. If you want to respond to a comment, you have to go out of the way to do so. The algorithm is poorly managed, theyll penalize you claiming it goes against their Community Standards when in reality, youve done nothing wrong. You cant get ahold of anyone to report any issues with the platform. It obviously politically motivated and biased, not too mention they wont stop bothering you about their personal agendas such as vaccination information that doesnt provide information at all. I wont recommend this app to anyone.",2
FB will do anything they can to get all information on you and sell it. They make it impossibly difficult and confusing to change your privacy settings. Its laid out that way so most people especially the older crowd cant figure out. Much better social media apps out there. Use something else! FB is dead!!,2
"My phone contact list was stolen without my approval !!! 
My friend whos on my contact list bought a product and i was advertised the same product on the next day! Hows that possible if i never searched for such a product and my friend doesnt have a Facebook account! And I didnt even open my Facebook account or messenger for months!! Facebook is the only social app i have on my phone. 
and this happened many times. even my phone   number was shared without permission with advertisers who called me. 
I fear this app is a spying tool on peoples privacy. 
Do Not Install this App.",2
It has become increasingly obvious that it is virtually impossible to use the FB app and not have them tracking everything you do even when the app isnt open and youre signed out. There is little doubt in my mind the CIA is directly involved with Zuckerberg and Facebook and it was developed specifically as a tool to track people and collect data.,2
"I dont like that Facebook collects our data and personalizes ads because it makes me look at more things to buy. Can we turn that feature off? I feel like its invasive. Also, there should be a way that we can pin important messages in groupchats on fb messenger.",2
"Lots of crashes being reported, never got an respond back, and crushes still there. Lot of fake accounts sending spam, and none of them was deleted after reports. Always answer its not harmful. Yes, if someone follow their link and loose money and personal information, its not harmful for Facebook but their standards do not care about you. 
Last one I was banned about Kyle and court ruled that he did nothing wrong. But Facebook thinks different way, court no matter to Facebook representatives, they strike you for 7 days if you support different option than Facebook",1
"Facebook used to be about community and sharing. All it is now is a glorified data miner for your data and they are making billions off of you. You give them your soul and they give your soul to others. 

Its become nothing more than mindless tv with advertisements everywhere. All eyes are on you and ears and location and likes and dislikes, etc. 

Facebook needs to be illegal. Its practices are.",2
My profile was hacked about a month ago. My email and password were changed so I wasnt able to get back into it. I was notified by email that this happened and followed a link to prove my identity. I submitted my personal information to this link and waited for them to confirm. After 48 hours they confirmed my ID and sent me a new password and a link to follow. It did not work. I emailed Facebook security to tell them it wasnt working and have not received a response in a very long time. I have contacted them now 3 times by email. I still have not received a response. I wish there was a phone number I could call to expedite this process. I am extremely dissatisfied with their service. If I could give a rating of zero I would.,2
"Listen, I know we all know about cookies and how the entire Internet is selling our information for profit all the time, but Facebook is the worst for it. Im pretty sure Facebook is even the CAUSE of it. You have ZERO privacy on facebook, its disgusting. Also racist censorship. Ugly app, ugly human who made the app hes probably a lizard. Do yourself a favor and just get off Facebook.",2
"Facebook has become the network of choice for the Democratic Socialist Party. They push an agenda of misinformation and only allow for just one side of a conversation. That one side is that of the Democratic Socialist Party. If the view is not in their, Facebook, best interest then they, Facebook, will censor those views. Facebook doesnt allow for a fair and equitable distribution of information so its members can make an informed decision on their own. If I couldve given a lower rating than 1 star I would have! So if you wish to have every post censored and even have ALL OF YOUR PRIVATE MESSAGES READ AND CENSORED. Then by all means download this tracking app and have your life made public! If you like being able to separate your public from private life get MeWe and Parlor apps!",1
Facebook turns people into products. They manipulate algorithms to spoon feed certain ideologies and to suppress others. All while making BILLIONS as they collect and sell every bit of personal information you provide. Youre literally just a human battery in the Matrix when you use Facebook. And free speech on the platform is highly suppressed. Theyre too busy catering to their woke agenda. Dont expect their alleged community standards team to be anything close to reasonable if youre not a full blown anarchy loving communist who hates America. It should be renamed community DOUBLE standards team. Youre better off deleting the app and watching how much better life can be when you dont have a 247 megaphone of actual disinformation doing everything that it can to control your perception of reality. Good luck and God bless. May the awakening continue...,2
"The weak security allowed my account to be hacked. The Facebook folks that dont exist locked down my account and probably will elimininate by the account, just that there is no one to talk to they make no investigation and I end up loosing all my pictures, friends and memories saved there. They should have costumer service for more than d charge money to their customers. 

Not sure it is worth it to even download it",2
"I wouldnt want my information been sold and also Facebook doesnt check for fact checkers wether they are capable of judging without a biases. Its like 1 person researching all this information about everything which is too much for one person to handle.
I also think that suppression of information is and has been enforced which in itself is a violation of freedom speech.",1
"1. Zero privacy they monitor your camera, microphone, your browser, and all your apps!!! AND sell it!!! Talk about invasion of privacy. 
2. SO many ads every other post from my friends is an ad. I deleted my account. Waste of time.
3. Dating is literally THE WORST, zero filters!!!!! Scrolling through. Every. Single. Scrap. In. A. 100mile. Radius.
Did I say every single one??? No joke. Waste of time.",2
"Not only has face book deleted several accounts Ive made because one of my old accounts got HACKED, it took months for me just to make a new one and I couldnt even put my full name or it would be deleted 24 hours later also now that I do have Facebook again after a couple weeks of having it, it wont let me post or even look at other peoples pictures without saying it cant fetch the data when I know its not WiFi or service it still will not let me post and its been several weeks, also why is Facebook so hard to get ahold of I still cant get a response! So this is my last attempt",2
You app is really lousy I have been hacked and to no avail they stole all my info and photos cant even sign all they got all my passwords and screen names now I am blocked your help services are really bad too they are no help whatsoever. Please help !!!!!!!!!,2
Up until yesterday I was always able to edit posts I made on personal pages from my phone on the FB app.  Today cannot. I can only edit posts if I use the desktop version on my cell phone browser or from the computer. Using the FB app I cannot edit anything. In fact when you click those 3 buttons in top right even what you see if different. What the heck Facebook?  I even reported issue.,2
"I was hacked back in April, and lost 10 years of memories and pictures and everything and tried so hard to get back into my account and its impossible to communicate with anybody from Facebook. It pretty much runs itself. Mark is a genius. But now Im trying to reset up accounts and I cant remember the password and when it says try another way its still asks for your password. Now I just want to set up a whole new account but Im debating as to whether or not I should even bother. What a pain in the butt and I could see that from the reviews theres a lot of other people that dont like Facebook either.",2
For some time Facebook fact check had been branding various posts as misleading info such as screen shots from CDC website or WHO directly. When pushed to remove or explain why the complaint gets no response and to date fake check still blurts post,2
On a pretty large but still limited data plan and havent hit the cap almost ever. Get a warning that Im close so I check whats going on. I see within the last 25 days FB has used 6G of data. Im thinking the reels feature they just added is preloading videos.,2
All day it has been saying no internet connection and not posting on my story and not loading my timeline like Facebook has just completely crashed. So I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and still saying no internet connection but Im on WiFi also tried on my cellular data and I can not log back in. This needs to be fixed ASAP!,1
Facebook please help me login to my Facebook account someone hacked my Facebook account and I really need your help please I have personal information there that is really personal  please can you fix it,2
I know it was my fault but I wasnt thinking ! Its so easy for someone to scam you and then try and scam your family and friends ! Facebook doesnt care either unless you buy an oculus ! I cant get back into my Facebook and my friends are saying this person that took over my Facebook is begging for money. Facebook is horrible ! They collect your data and dont care about you .,2
"Facebook deleted an account that was hacked that I owned for 15 years. Multiple attempts to deactivate have left with nothing because there is NOTHING you can do. And since you are not paying for the app they dont care. Everyone who has ever used this app knows that they make money off of you one way or another. But for me, 15 years of memories, 2 biz pages and an IG account hacked and gone no content I ever posted is in any group or community. Its theft of ideas, memories relationships because they choose not to help. Then they blame the lack of customer service in covid. It is sad how intertwined we have become with this format and yet they have no responsibility in what they have created.",1
"This app or better, this company more and more wants to spy on us, last to have access to our documents. Pat in the end to sell them, more and more they want to control their clients according to how they want to protect our information, everything is a lie.",2
Facebook is silencing people and deleting their post. Their loyalty was never to their customers. The privacy is something to be concerned with. As well as if you would like to write and spread awareness about a humanitarian issue think agian before using Facebook. Because theyll delete your posts if the government told them to.,2
Facebook blocked me from marketing my legal businesses. They have censored free speech. They violate your privacy and sell your data . Some even say it's a CIA operative. Huge data collection facilities in Utah,2
In the last 6 months Facebook business page has become a big hassle. I cant toggle back and forth from my personal page easily.  Every function has become difficult to use. Please make it user friendly again.,2
"This app is useless and I havent used it in ages, Im scared of posting anything due to censorship, getting my information stolen, and getting banned for being myself. Ive honestly given up on social media because of all the censorship now a days",1
I really wish family was not on this app so I could get rid of it. The fact that my oculus needs a profile to be used is  stupid. The day Valve releases a standalone VR headset Im jumping ship. Start giving a  about your community and our privacy. Try not to be so evil. We are people.,1
This app is awful but thats besides the point. Your information is being sold to the highest bidder and then used against you. Will never use Facebook again. What they are doing amp getting away with is criminal. Delete your accounts unless you want your private info sold to 3rd partys. Bye yuckaburgh ,1
Facebook openly and illegally censors posts about human rights violations by the terrorist state which calls itself Israel while simultaneously stealing personal data and information from its users to sell that information at a profit.,2
Freedom is not just an idea. This app was supposed to be our town square. It has become something evil and ugly where the truth is hidden and lies are promoted. Its used to track and advertise and truck people into making decisions based on false information. The world is better without it.,2
Read all the privacy and agreements hidden ones too and they steal all your info and sell it. The make it extremely difficult for someone to research what they do with your info. They steal info including stores you visit from your location so they can target ads and so much more let alone the political silencing on both sides. Dont recommend getting this toxic app.,2
Havent logged on in at least a month. One day the app decided it needed to verify my identity. But when I type in my password it asks me to generate my own code somehow. From what the internet says I need access to the account to use its code generator why it doesnt send a code to my phone to verify is something I dont understand. Greatest thing about Facebook is the complete lack of support. Sell our data all day and night cant even get support for more complex issues it just really shows how much the company DOES NOT CARE.,1
I would be having a conversation about something and minutes later theres an add about it on my news feed. How can this be legal for them to creep on your conversations??? Its so intrusive. Also why am I not allowed to remove my last name on there? What if Im Concerned about my privacy? You have little to no control what you can do on fb. Why does the cover photo have to be made public so your stalkers can see whos liking your photo? I will be deleting this ASAP and sticking with FaceTime if I want to stay in touch with family. And as much as money fb is making off their ads Im surprised that its dang near impossible to get a hold of an actual live person to resolve an issue. In fact its impossible. What a joke.,2
Very frustrating. Facebook used to be a place to stay connected with old friendsdistant family etc. now its just adds and poorly managed accounts. Theres no real way to filter out hateful content or other that you dislike. Messenger is a separate app. Everything requires your personal information so it can track you and try to sell you more garbage. Horrible experience.,2
Gathering info on its client base and selling this information to the highest bidder is an evil practice. Facebook is a company that takes advantage of its users and attempts to manipulate public opinion and police thought. Screw these guys,2
"I hate Facebook. I used to love this platform. Im deleting my account that Ive had for over a decade. Id rather lose touch with people than give Facebook and more minute of my time, or allowing them to make another dollar off of my personal data. 

Mark Zuckerberg and his company have ruined the world. I hope they get whats coming to them because this whistleblower is right. FB is pissing people off on purpose to keep them scrolling. Shame!",2
"they force you to watch shorts reels and many ads 
you can have personal problems because you cannot remove this videos from appearing on the app fix this we need to choose what features we want and which we dont",2
Zuckerberg is a sellout impeding our right to free speech to match their agenda. I only use because friends and family use. Seek a better platform this one is a privacy mining political agenda serving trash can.,1
I would really love a Facebook will update their app for the iPad so that I could create an avatar and stop getting the message it needs to be updated. I would also like for Facebook to stop sharing my information when I make it private and for my use only Im tired of seeing ads based off of my age which is a private and all the other crap ads based off of location that is again private. Get your act together Facebook. I want to see my friends posts not ads and posts from three and four days ago.,2
"Facebook please make a feature like Instagram has, for our highlights and stories we have on Facebook we should be able to see who watches our highlights and stories it should show everyone regardless if youre not friends with someone on the app for OUR OWN SAFETY and PRIVACY. Some people have legitimate people that want to hurt them, you guys need to make a feature where we can see who watches our highlights and our story even if we are not friends on Facebook. It shouldnt be anonymous its not fair. People can stock us, and they get protected?? yeah no.",2
I finally updated my Facebook to see if it fixed this .. it hasn't. I am unable to share onto my personal page from my photography business page. When i type in my name with  Without  sign. Very annoying to those of us that need that function.  Its been over a month! Im still a bit shy of 250. I have to post to my personal page separately .. and then link  sign to go to my business page. Most dont!,2
So many flaws regarding listing on marketplace to different buy sell groups. Also today I am unable to send any photos or videos on FB or messenger and it is telling me I need to give it access via setting but there is no option to change this. So frustrating.,2
Horrible business practices. AntiAmerican antidemocracy. App wants all my data just to function properly. Started getting ads for things that I spoke about around my phone and never actually typed into my phone.,2
"Facebook is not safe anymore. Nobody can have personal online privacy without local or unknown people placing their force fed unwanted advertising or personal blogging junk on others newsfeeds. Nobody can express themselves and their entitled opinions anymore without someone feeling so offended that they have to cry like a little 5 yr to Facebook admins as if the sky was about to fall on them. Facebooks community standards are nothing but a joke. Whats the purpose of having Facebook, Twitter and so on if one cant enjoy themselves safely and securely?",2
"I got hacked by someone 2 years ago 
and cant even get in my own profile. I 
send my photo ID to them and it let me change my password but i can not get into it because it requires a 6 digit code that is not coming to my phone!!! I guess my hacker changed my phone number so i cant get into it to find out. I sent sooooo
many messages to fb help but i cant get any help. When they had my account they changed my profile picture,And before they changed my pic they messaged 
allll my friends and asked for money!! Making me look like a begger. Embarrassing me. And some of my friends sent them 200 at a time for a light bill 
they told them i couldnt pay!!!! You know because they was Pretending to be me!!!
Still havent gotten it resolved to this day
and i want my profile back.",1
"Ive had my account hacked and money tried to spend through Facebook Pay and have gotten zero support. If your app is going to allow people to steal money from them, then give us a spot to report the illegal theft!!!!!",2
"Forces you to use terrible 2factor authentication, and then when it doesnt send you a code to your app, you have to SEND THEM A PICTURE OF YOUR ID to get back into your account.

Not to mention that the app itself is disgusting bloatware  spyware that tracks you across everything else you do on your phone, even though Facebook lies and says they dont do that.",2
"The app keeps getting updated to where if you run a page, its impossible to do anything. Trying to share content takes me to my personal page, making events is unintuitive, and its just an overall clunky mess.",2
"As of this latest update, Aug 20th, 2022, I am unable to update a post on my personal page or on a business page. If a mistake is found I have to delete and repost it. You are only able to update the privacy settings. This is frankly quite problematic",2
I got locked out of my Facebook account and now Facebook will not let me back in unless I send them a picture of my drivers license or passport. Why does a social media website need my identification cards? I dont want Facebook selling my driver license information to other companies.,2
Facebook is different than before. Now we have the thought police fact checkspying on everyone and all are judging our every word. American people are still free so far. It would be nice to have Facebook stand up for the Constitutions rights for all.,2
My account has been hacked and someone changed my email and it is impossible to get any assistance in correcting the matter. To make things worse I had a very close family member pass away and all of my favorite pictures right no longer have access to.I am extremely disappointed and would urge all others to ban Facebook Until they have a better security system in place.,2
"Facebook, you can change the culture, facilitate revolutions in foreign countries, influence US elections, and be the sole arbitrator for what content can be seen on your communication tool that is used by millions around the globe, but you cant help me to regain access to my FB account that has been hijacked by someone using a hotmail account despite my following all of your protocols.",2
"Absolutely hate this app. There is so many things that are wrong... where to begin... but my main concern is their security and privacy policies, the data they collect without your permissions etc. They are bullying you into stupid updates, promotions and push other crap on you. Terrible. I deleted it finally after years of use, just could not deal with it anymore.
P.s. you can shove your liberal agenda you know where",2
"Disgusting social engineering company. This app is insanely INVASIVE, just read the Personal Data Shared section of the Apple Store listing for this app.

If you do Fakebook, use a privacyrespecting browser like BraveNOT Edge or Chrome!!with thirdparty cookies shut off. ",1
"Facebook has continually showed that it is possible to fail over and over again with regards to privacy, corporate governance, moderation and also pushing extremism. One of the worst apps ever created for this store and a chapter we all hope to close on the Web 2.0 days soon.",2
"My account was hacked in the middle of the night.  They managed to get through the two factor Authenticator and add their own email to MY account.  Im unable to get back into my account that Ive had since the very beginning of Facebook.  Theres no customer support email, chat, phone number, etc.  just the useless help desk that brings you around in circles with nothing being resolved.  Do the research  hundreds of account having the same hacking issue even though they consider themselves secure.",2
"What has happened to the post editing feature? Also, The use of my personal page and business page is no longer seamless.what have you done? Every time I figure FB out, you make changes. Please leave it alone!!",2
Looking at my notification badge and it says I have 66 new notifications. When I open it up it only says I have 2. What is the problem with the discrepancy? Fix this and you get more stars. Also why no landscape mode on the iPhone? It works fine on iPad. Update 2 facebooks privacy issues have basically fixed me to keep this at a one star rating. Also its policy of misinformation and blocking the truth.,2
"If i could i would give it a 0
Facebook has gone downhill in a fast and unethical way. They dont care about the user per se but rather the users analytics  data. This app is nothing more than a tracker that unfortunately even tracks your offline activity just so they can sell your info. If you value privacy and your 1st Amendment Right to Free Speech, then THIS APP IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU!! Nothing more than spambloatware",1
"This appsite will take all of your personal data and info and sell it to companies, and is also seriously censoring people who are trying to share important news. Deleted my account and the app, good riddance!",2
"My Husbands account was hacked after having it for 15 years. Someone made an inappropriate post, and they locked his account for review. They never sent a single notification or email. He waited for two months while his account was under review with absolutely no steps or actions provided for resolution. Never received a single communication about the process. If I hadnt seen that his account was hacked by a random post he didnt make he would have no idea what happened and no way to protect his information. After all of this time, he just received notification that his account has been permanently disabled, because too much time has elapsed to review his account. Excuse me?? What have you been doing for two months?! This is just terrible business practices, youre too busy stealing data to care for your users. TERRIBLE BUSINESS, lackadaisical practices and good riddance! Glad I dont own any stock, this company is going down the tubes. Get. It. Together. For such a massive company, you certainly dont know what youre doing.",2
My account has been hacked again and I cant get back into this is the second time and the first account I continue to try to get disabled and continues to be in use!!!!! Will I lose all of my information again in a major leak of my private data,2
"Put on your tin foil hats to deflect the mind control signal coming from the Illuminati! Mr. Zuckaburger is a giant lizard person trying to take control of you and your family!! Look at his evil snake eyes and reptilian smile. He may cry to try to impersonate emotions but those are really, in a literal sense, crocodile tears. Stop this crazed lunatic and big government busy bodies from bossing us around. Stop big capita, cancel cancel culture, and protect our personal data! God Bless Murica,
 Amen",2
"Facebooks algorithms do not make me feel safe with my opinions and personal information , I also dont trust the algorithms to give me the full truth, only what they want me to know.  I therefore have deleted my account and will no longer use them",2
"My account was hacked Im in the same boat as the user in another review it also states it will be looked over within 24 hours and it hasnt in 5 days 
Some posted inappropriate pictures on my account. This page is also contains my business page which I cant access and none of your problem solving help center will do anything 
Annoyed",2
"Do not even get into Facebook. Frankly, I wish that I never set up an account. The email and phone you give it will track your purchases on your credit card. Not even kidding. Bought deodorant and then I hopped onto Facebook and there was an ad for that specific brand. Not cool. You have no right to my data Facebook and I hope your company gets split up for privacy violations. This should be illegal.",2
"I dont like mark SuckItburg stealing and selling all of my info to whoever he feels like making a dime from. Get off social media, stop letting it destroy your mind. Go out, talk to people. Social media has single handily destroyed civilization.",2
Facebook has become an absolute joke and a traitor to American people. They censor us and track us and give the information to people with nefarious plans against us. We need to stop this from continuing and work to have Facebook removed.,2
"Too much censorship, cant express yourself freely anymore. 
Fact checkers is everywhere with info theyve got from unreliable sources. 
Facebook groups wont allow to even make a post anymore unless its a for sell post overall everything has went downhill.",2
I had my snapchat account for about 8 years and suddenly my account keeps getting locked when i go to file a complaint it tell me delete third partie apps or stop sending spam i could tell you now i have done none of those my first account that has gotten locked recently holds many of my memories and personal information then i made another account and that one has gotten locked too and im on my THIRD account and it repeatedly keeps getting locked. SNAPCHAT FIX YOUR APP im very angry because of this and i would not be using this app anymore,2
"I logged out of my Facebook account just now. My login information was not saved whatsoever. I can click on my profile picture to login but since I forgot my password, Facebook has me search up my phone number or email address to find my account why????. Note that I have my email address and phone number in this account already. When I search my for my profile with my email and also tried my phone number , it says no accounts match that information.

Now I have to make a brandnew account.

Perhaps, I may even delete the app permanently because how terrible the app is anyway. Facebook, please fix this.",2
"Ive had Facebook since I have 17 years old and I am 37 years old Ive never had as much issue as now.

"Facebook is an evil globalist spy entity engaged in outright social engineering and manipulation of the wordwide population. 

With more power than any of the early 20th century monopolies, Facebook is the manifestation of an OrwellianHuxleyesque dystopic nightmare that infects and afflicts and subverts humanity and all core values of freedom of speech and association, individual rights, privacy, etc. 

This is a demonic bastardization of all of the good that this technology could provide. 

All involved should be ashamed... AND IN PRISON.",2
"In July I got hacked , Facebook notified me via email but it was 3am when it happened so I was asleep. When I woke up an found that it had. I hurried and tried to do everything to get it secured. It was to late. I was able to get my email changed back in the account but the hacker enabled 2 factor authentication and change my phone number so I am stuck. Locked out of my account. So now I cannot even log into my account. I have reached out to Facebook for 4 months straight trying to get them to respond is to no luck. I have submitted my drivers license ID 80 times with the same response of we need an acceptable form of ID. IT IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM , its the first one that you can select when submitting it. FACEBOOK get your crap together. I have lost access to all my photos  memories of my now deceased grandma because you allowed someone to hack into my account so easily. I have lost access to my business page causing me to lose a lot of my income. This is ridiculous.",2
"I am writing to tell you that I can no longer edit my own personal posts. I am not a business so I should not be subject to those rules.

This is my own personal Facebook page and I should be able to edit misspellings and other mistakes that I make in a post. 

I can edit my comments on my post but not the actual post itself. Please fix this. Thanks.",2
"My Facebook was hacked, and Facebook wont do anything to help me get my account back. Every message from my now deceased father is gone. Messages, pictures, memories, all held hostage by Facebook that I am unable to see. There is no one to help me. Its horrible.",1
For the past week i been having trouble logging into my account.. Im not even sure why I even got locked out my account in the 1st place.. I was NOT hacked.. every time I request a login code  it says a code was sent to my phone number thats on my account but NOOO code is coming through.. Ive gone through everything I could in the help center but unfortunately NOTHING is helping.. fb gets no stars from me until I can get back into my account..,1
"I had lost my facebook because of an ex boyfriend who had hacked into my facebook by taking a photo of my id and sending it in. Facebook accepted it and kicked me out. He had changed my password and all my security questions to log back in. I tried sending a photo of my id but facebook doesnt think i am me facebook thinks someone else is me because they got a picture of my id. I now have no social media besides instagram which i rarely use, and many many years of memories that can not be replaced. Breaks my heart. Thanks facebook.",2
Im a Millennial who downloaded the Facebook  Instagram apps for the first time ever about 2 weeks ago give or take. So far I LOVE both apps BUT Im having a LOT of issues with receiving push notifications from the Facebook app to my iPhones Notification Center despite removing the app and redownloading it after 24 hours and ensuring that all my notifications both in app and in my phone are set correctly. I would really appreciate it if you could look into this and send a big fix if necessary. Thank you and have a Happy New Year!,2

"Literally the worst thing thats happened to society since the holocaust. Big tech is the epitome of evil. And yet here we are still using their products while they harvest our data and manipulate us with their algorithms. Im as guilty as anyone else in still using it, but find myself constantly asking, why are we doing this to ourselves?",1
Its one tho g to be online and keep contact with friends but to find out your info is being shared wo your knowledge with outside parties is horrible . Not to mention when you then once you speak up on it are kicked out of your Facebook account . Come on do better be better !,2
"There are well detailed complaints already posted about the failings of Facebook. We've long been aware of the crimes and offenses of the Zuckerberg lead company. Our hope is that their spying, stealing, and general indifference to you and us catches up with them, and that they come to realize their egregious offenses, which are perpetrated against us, freedom, and the privileges they enjoy but deprive of others, such as privacy. Bravo to those exFacebook employees who have spoken out against this corrupted company.",2
"If you like being told what youre allowed to talk about as well as someone having access to your texts, email, app data, location data, camera, photos and literally everything else so they can sell it to other corps for money, then by all means, use fb. Oh yeah, did I mention fb has the highest number of child exploitation cases of any websiteapp in the world? They sure can take down posts about Q but they cant do anything about child prn.",2
I downloaded the app ans have been unable to use it . I cancelled my account last year as it was hacked and just created a new account about 1 week ago . I downloaded the app and I cannot log in because I get an error code. I am able to log in online . I wrote to Facebook 3 times and no response  it is very frustrating not to be able to have a support line to call .,2
"With each update recently the app becomes less responsive.  And too many fake friends requests when its already set in privacy as friends of friends only. Its really annoying and a bit creepy, please fix.",2
"Facebook is the worst business in the world. They use their platform to harass people, will not allow you to delete your profile, if you do not agree with their infringement of your 1st amendment rights, they allow your profile to ne hacked and allow the hackers to pretend they are you. This company, gave millions to Wisconsin, for crooked drop boxes, and is the most infringing organization on personal privacy of any organization!",1
"I enjoy Facebook. But the customer support is crap. Then ensuring your safety and privacy is a lie. I had my Facebook hacked and so have a bunch of other people. There is no way to directly contact someone and even though several people have reported my Facebook as hacked they still have not done anything about it. The guy who hacked my Facebook is conversating, laughing, and messing with my friends and family including my kid. Thinking this who thing is a joke. I have personal information on my Facebook and they are not protecting my privacy. I am scared for my safety and the information he most liky accessed including my home address. They need to figure out a better system and take care of issues like this immediately. They want to kick people off for petty issues but will not help resolve important issues. Facebook is a good way for keeping in touch with family and friends but they do not ensure your safety or privacy like they say they do.",1
My profile got hacked that I had for 12 years and I reported it at least 30 times and every one of my friends on Facebook reported it. And Facebook did nothing about it. Never deleted the page or anything and I had a lot of personal information that the hacker used trying to spam others that where friends with me on Facebook.,2

Facebook Marketplace is filled with scams and scammers. Theres is more fake listings than ever and when you try to sell anything your inbox gets filled with scammers trying to steal your phone number through a Google voice sms. This is incredibly frustrating as a buyer and a seller.,2
"Designed to be addictive, no regard for personal privacy and fact checkers algorithms actively suppress free speech while sending user into dangerous echo chambers.

If I wanted the government spying on me and having access to all my stuff I would live in China. If I wanted the government to control what I post or sale or even fact check I would move to North Korea.

"This app can show and see your location without your permission even if youre not using it. Mark Zuckerburg cares only about his wallet and following the governments lead, regardless of what it is.

"Honestly over the past months I have been getting a lot of bugs in Facebook, videos not playing properly, sound system always quite, and honestly after the allegations that Facebook steals personal info made me more disappointed toward the app that I have been using since 2014, other platforms have been improved in the past years over Facebook as, Twitter, Snapchat and etc. 
Thank you",2
I am a car salesman and I am constant removed from marketplace and under review. They always give me back my privileges but it takes forever limits my ability to market and make a living. They say I went against community standards when none of my market place post do. I am a outspoken conservative on my personal private page and I believe that is why my marketplace account is constantly under scrutiny.,2
Facebook was designed to manipulate its users by feeding them biased content in an endless feed. They sell your information to anyone who will pay them for it. You are being watched. Delete the App and look into decentralized social platforms like Mastodon.,1
"Constant updates that mess things up. More and more invasive into privacy and the censorship is ridiculous. If Facebook doesnt like your post even if its respectful and truthful they will just delete it or suspend accounts, theyll delete huge groups with thousands of members if they dont like what the topics of conversations are. Shameful!",2
"I have two accounts, one for business and another for personal. Both have been suspended for absolutely no reason! It even says on the support page no violations! But my reports for FB fall on deaf ears! Horrible!",1
What I dont understand is how they work and operate. They want to change people from being who they are. They bloc yu for nothing and then there are people naked and selling sex but yet I cant express my feelings and self. They allowing too many people to hac into people pages. Their privacy sucs. They rules only apply to some people. Its just crazy,2
Facebook is complete and utter communist propaganda. They will allow popular  stories that  make the communist party look wonderful but censor the negative issues about China like they use  slaves to make  goods for first world  countries. I wish I never even supplied an ounce of personal data on this sight. I'm sure the communist Chinese are taking notes and names getting ready for the coming great reset.,2
My account was hacked and there is legitimately no way of contacting Facebook for help. No phone number or email address at all. All my memories and photos are lost forever. Use this as a social network site if you dont value security or memories,2
"I dont use FB much any more, although I used to be a daily user. Lately when logging in FB wont accept my login info. Ive had to change the password so many times its not with the trouble. Also, started a business link and everything that could go wrong did. FB isnt worth the effort and time to jump though all those good. Especially knowing how they gather personal data for their own use, shadow ban conservative posts by play police. Im simply done with Facebook. Went from good to rotten due to their corrupt practices.",2
Just like some other street catcaller Facebook is a place for such illegal activity where protection and privacy is a big question. Facebook proved its creation reason everytime after all it was made by a desperate insecure criminal guymark to invade and spoil others reputation and privacy .,2
"I used FBk for about 1 year. I was blocked by Marco the fascist for about 5 months. 
So I left. Closed my FBK account. 
Rq. I have proves that I used the same words that other used against me in their posts. I keep screen shots of those conversations.",2
"Facebook spies on everything I do on my phone. I I go to safari and look something up Facebook starts slamming me with adds that relate to it. 
Enough already! Sometimes I am just looking things up to learn.",2
"this app and website has begun as a dating website by a loser in college and now this loser is collecting and selling peoples private information and data, besides, trying to be a propaganda machine biased against many victims and innocent people, which expose the real mentality and ethics of the loser who only wanted someone to notice him by stealing another fraternity idea",2
Facebook is a terrible companyplatform. They care not about anything about money. The more security and privacy you have the less they make. Which is why I deleted my account two years ago and never looked back,1
NOTHING BUT SPAM ADS!!!! THERE IS AN AD EVERYBTHIRD POST!!! ITS RIDICULOUS AT THIS POINT!!! REFUSES TO HIDE MARKETPLACE ADS!!!!!!! GROUPS NEVER WORKS!!!!! THESE DEVELOPERS HAVE DESTROYED THIS APP!!!!!! FACEBOOK IS MAKING IT OBVIOUS THEY NO LONGER CARE!!!!,2
For a little more than a week now I am not getting notifications for likes or replies to my comments. I have Facebook so that I can have conversations with people and no notifications means I cant have conversations unless I go back to my comment or post to see them. I keep reporting the problem with 0 response,2
"Facebook is no longer what is used to be, they censor everything if it doesnt follow their agendas and they make money off of your Data information, they no longer have any context to what privacy means anymore, use it a your own risk!",2
"Just because I watch one video, doesnt mean I want to keep watching the same content creator or close to the same videos. People like a variety. I hate this feature of you tracking everything I watch online. I watched 2 videos of a creator and the next day my feed was full of nothing but their videos. This is what makes people unfollow some creators.",2
It is SO infuriating FB refuses access to all Created Friends Lists in app!! Ridiculous!! Not all of us own computers so we can actually use fb properly!! Mobile fb website is now useless with new update!! No access to any settings or left side bar on mobile site!! We want classic full desktop site access in mobile Safari!!,2
They deserve less than one star rating. They have gotten to big for their own good. They want to control what we post and see. What we buy by suggesting items they have tracked across apps. Good for Apple by not removing the low star ratings. And even better that Apple gives us the choice of not wanting apps to track us. Something that Fakebook heavily uses to make money at the cost of privacy of users.,2
So the Facebook app is now hijacking AirPlay connections from other apps to play its own media and completely ignoring the Play in iPhone setting. This is a serious privacy and security bug that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.,2
"its getting annoying, it keeps saying there was a error fetching the data everytime i click on the app, it wont let me message anybody and i have deleted and re downloaded the app multiple times, ive tried to update it but its already up to date.
its getting on my nerves.",2
This app is horrible. There is no freedom of speech with them they constantly block your posts if it doesnt line up with their thoughts or beliefs. Constant monitoring of what you say or do. The whole thing should be deemed a violation of privacy and they should be shut down permanently!!!,2
"If I could give Facebook less than 1 star, I would. 
Zero customer service. I worked on my business page for 5 years and was hacked on my personal account and lost complete access to my business page. I had to create a new business page, and facebook wont even let me create a new one! It just keep saying query error. Absolutely disgusting that a company is allowed to have absolutely zero customer service, no live support chat, no phone number, no one to respond to emails, nothing. Honestly I cant wait for a better platform to come out and put facebook in the ground. Or someone who knows what theyre doing to take over facebook and make necessary changes.",2
"Why are other people allowed to share MY postphoto but I cant see it because of THEIR privacy settings? How does that make any sense when its my content to begin with? How do I know Im not being bashed or made fun of?! If someone shares my stuff, I should be able to see it. Period. Also, if you want people to use Reels more professionally make it so we can choose our own cover photo for the reel cause the ones you all choose are awful. And almost all of my reels are muted with copyright claims. I chose songs from the available library you all have for your users using the Audio function. Why is this happening?! Update this, please! Can we be more uptodate like TikTok and Instagram? I mean, dont yall own Instagram? Come on now. The reels for Facebook is such an outdated editing feature. Oh, and thank you! I do love Facebook.",2
"So many glitches and the advertising is completely out of control. They are already stealing all of our personal information in exchange for using their app, and now they are harassing us with ads every 1 to 2 posts. Ridiculous.",2
"My account was cloned even after setting up two party authentication and changing password to an impossible to guess series of letters, numbers, and symbols. Settings for privacy and notifications dont work, so I shouldnt be surprised. A myriad of problems with this app, plus the fact its owned by an evil communist.",2
"After the election results I left Facebook app. permanently. They sold our information, spied on our private messages, censored conservative voices, interfered in our elections. Im sick that after many years of supporting them they betrayed us conservatives. I cant support this app anymore. Im out.",2
"My account has been hacked and my identity has been compromised. I have tried to contact Facebook as for help and they continue to empower the HACKER!!

The hacker has stolen my identity and changed emails and phone numbers to steal money from family  friends!!!

Facebook has NOT helped and continues to provide access to the Hacker ",1
