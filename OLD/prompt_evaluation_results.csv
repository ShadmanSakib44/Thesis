This is very close to communistnazi behavior and is unacceptable in a free country.","
As a user, I am dissatisfied with the lack of privacy and bias present on the website. Specifically, I object to the fact that the site does not allow me to post my opinions without fear of retribution or censorship. This behavior is unacceptable in a free country, as it restricts my right to express my thoughts and beliefs.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability on the site's part. If the site is biased towards one particular perspective, I expect them to be transparent about it and provide evidence to support their claims. However, instead, they seem to be selectively presenting information in a way that supports their own agenda, which is not only unfair but also unethical.

In addition, I am concerned about the potential for flashing or taking down my posts without providing any justification or evidence. This type of behavior can be seen as censorship and is not acceptable in a free country. It also undermines the integrity of the online platform and makes it difficult for users to express their opinions freely.

As a true Patriot and Constitutional Conservative, I am tired of being censored and influenced by social media companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

User Story:
As a long-time member of Facebook, I have been a loyal user for over a decade. However, in recent times, I was banned from posting anything in Messenger private groups, which includes my personal accounts on Facebook and Instagram. This ban is due to the community standards of spying on private chat groups.

Goal:
My primary goal is to get my accounts reinstated and regain access to my personal information and data.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. My Facebook and Instagram accounts should be restored.
2. All of the banned content should be removed from my Messenger private group.
3. I should be able to restore all of the pictures and login credentials for third-party apps and mobile games that I invested time and money in.

But I learned a valuable lesson, you dont have any rights to your profiles, pictures, conversations, or business information etc, they can take it away and not give it back at any given time. I have spent many hours researching, sending emails, trying different things etc. to no avail. Thanks Facebook for the complete disappointment and for completely not caring about your customers.","
As a user who had an account on both Facebook and Instagram, I want to be able to recover my disabled accounts so that I can access my profiles, pictures, conversations, and business information again."

Now FB is sending out more of their own garbage than I get from friends. Even though I have clearly requested NO memories, they keep sending more and more. Their reporting system is a waste of time. The buttons on anything they send you dont work and when used just eats up data for hours at a time. I am flooded with Suggested Pages, Friendverseries, Videos, etc and the buttons dont work. The more you report, the more they send.","
As a Facebook user, I want to be able to delete or hide my previous posts and interactions from the platform so that I can control the amount of data I receive from it. I am sick of receiving constant suggestions, friend updates, videos, and other content from Facebook that does not interest me, and I would like to have more control over what information is sent to me on the platform.

Background:
I have been a user of Facebook for several years and have a significant amount of posts and interactions on the platform. However, in recent months, I have noticed an increase in the amount of content that I receive from Facebook that does not interest me. This has included suggestions, friend updates, videos, and other content from the platform that I do not wish to see.

Goal:
My goal is to be able to delete or hide my previous posts and interactions from Facebook so that I can control the amount of data I receive from it. I want to be able to turn off the constant stream of suggestions, friend updates, videos, and other content that I do not wish to see on the platform.

Benefit:
By being able to delete or hide my previous posts and interactions from Facebook, I will be able to reduce the amount of data I receive from the platform and have more control over what information is sent to me. This will allow me to use the platform in a way that is more convenient for me and will also help me save time and battery life on my device.

Acceptance Criteria:

* The ability to delete or hide specific posts and interactions from Facebook
* The option to turn off constant streams of suggestions, friend updates, videos, and other content that I do not wish to see on the platform
* A clear way to indicate which posts and interactions I wish to keep or delete
* The ability to review my deleted or hidden posts and interactions before they are actually removed from the platform
* The option to restore deleted or hidden posts and interactions if needed
* The ability to track the number of deleted or hidden posts and interactions on the platform
* A clear notification system for when I have reached a limit on the number of deleted or hidden posts and interactions that I can have on the platform
* The ability to request support from Facebook staff if I need help with deleting or hiding specific content on the platform."

As a Facebook user, I want to be able to flag content that I believe is incorrect or misleading so that I can help make Facebook a more accurate and trustworthy platform. However, I do not want to be penalized for fact-checking personal information about my family members or other individuals who are important to me. Similarly, I do not want to be prevented from flagging memes or photos because they may be considered offensive or inappropriate by some users.

Instead, I believe that Facebook should have a more nuanced approach to content moderation, taking into account the context and intent behind the post. If a user flags a post as incorrect or misleading, it should be reviewed by a human moderator who can assess the situation and make an informed decision about whether the post should be removed from the platform.

Additionally, Facebook should provide users with more information about how its fact-checking process works and how they can report inappropriate or misleading content that is not accurate. This would help to reduce the number of false positives and ensure that users are able to use the platform in a way that feels safe and secure.

Overall, Facebook needs a more balanced approach to content moderation that takes into account the complexity of modern social media platforms and the diverse perspectives of its users. By providing users with more information and tools to help them report and flag inappropriate content, Facebook can create a more accurate and trustworthy platform that serves all of its users."

My passport is not recognized as a valid form of identification by Facebook, which has left me with no recourse for proofing my identity.

To address this issue, Meta should provide alternative forms of identification or offer a more effective method for users to prove their identity in cases where they believe their account has been hacked. Providing customer support numbers and ensuring that all communications are conducted in a secure and professional manner can also help to alleviate user frustration and ensure that their concerns are addressed in a timely and effective manner.

As a user of Meta's social media platform, I am deeply concerned about the company's handling of free speech in relation to the conflict in Palestine. Facebook has been criticized for its role in spreading misinformation and propaganda related to the crisis, and for its failure to properly moderate content that violates its policies.

Moreover, Facebook has also been accused of censoring or removing content that expresses opposition to its policies or practices. This not only undermines the free exchange of ideas but also creates a chilling effect on those who seek to speak out against injustice and human rights abuses.

Furthermore, I believe that Facebook has a responsibility to ensure that its platform is safe and free from harmful content, including hate speech and misinformation. The company's failure to address these issues effectively is not only a violation of its users' privacy but also a betrayal of its core values as a platform for free expression and open communication.

Therefore, I request that Meta take immediate action to address the issue of censorship on its platform and ensure that all voices are able to freely express themselves without fear of retribution or harm. This includes implementing stricter policies and procedures for moderation and taking appropriate action against any content that violates these policies.

Additionally, I suggest that Meta engage in open and honest dialogue with users who have been affected by censorship and provide them with mechanisms to report and address such incidents. This would not only help to build trust between the company and its users but also promote a safer and more respectful online environment.

In conclusion, Meta has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to user privacy and free speech by taking concrete steps to address censorship on its platform. I hope that this review will serve as a catalyst for change and inspire the company to take responsibility for protecting and promoting the safety and security of all users."

Additionally, the company should be transparent about its data collection and use practices and provide users with clear information about how their data is being used.

As a user, I would like the following features or improvements to be implemented to improve my experience with Facebook:

1. Ability to recover access to a hacked account: I want the ability to recover access to my hacked Facebook account, including any photos and memories that were stored on the platform. This feature should allow me to log in using a trusted device or method, such as a backup email address or a recovery code.
2. Password reset functionality: I would like to be able to reset my password if I forget it, rather than being unable to access my account due to a forgotten password. This functionality should allow me to enter my email address or other contact information to receive a password reset link or code.
3. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): To add an extra layer of security to my account, I would like Facebook to implement MFA. This could involve using a trusted device, such as a smartphone or tablet, and entering a one-time code sent via text message or authenticator app.
4. Email address recovery: If I no longer use the email address associated with my Facebook account, I would like the ability to recover access to my account by providing a backup email address or other contact information.
5. Access to business accounts: As someone who has had their Facebook account hacked and lost access to their business accounts, I would appreciate the ability to regain access to these accounts using a trusted device or method.
6. Password management tools: To help me manage my passwords securely, Facebook could provide password management tools such as password generators, password managers, and password encryption.
7. Two-factor authentication (2FA): This feature would add an extra layer of security to my account by requiring a second form of verification, such as a fingerprint or a one-time code sent via text message, in addition to my password.
8. Account security settings: To improve my overall security on Facebook, I would like the ability to review and manage my account's security settings, including MFA, password reset functionality, email address recovery, and access to business accounts.

Overall, these features and improvements would help me regain control of my hacked Facebook account and ensure that my personal information is secure."

They censor what information theyd like you to receive.

As a user, I am concerned about the recent changes made to the company's algorithms that make it more difficult for individuals trying to advertise their business on the platform. These changes have led to a decrease in the number of businesses being able to reach new customers through the platform, which has a negative impact on my ability to find relevant and useful information.

Furthermore, I am also concerned about the fact that the company censor's certain types of content and only allows specific types of advertising. This not only limits the diversity of advertisements available but also creates a biased environment where certain businesses are given more opportunities to reach new customers than others.

Additionally, I am concerned about the amount of information that is collected by the company, including my microphone usage and every piece of my existence and usage. This not only raises privacy concerns but also creates a sense of surveillance, which can be unsettling for me as a user.

Title: Unrecoverable Facebook Page

As a user, I am extremely disappointed that my Facebook page has been hacked and taken over by an unauthorized individual. The person in question has been attempting to retrieve the account, but their attempts have resulted in my personal information being compromised and used to scam my friends.

I had invested a lot of time and effort into maintaining my Facebook page, which was created as a platform for me to connect with my friends and share updates about my life. However, due to the hack, my page has been taken over by an unknown person who has used it to scam my friends and spread false information.

The most disturbing aspect of this situation is that the person in question has been trying to recover the account multiple times, but each time they have access to my personal information. This has led to me losing trust in Facebook's ability to protect user data and recover compromised accounts.

I urge Facebook to take immediate action to address this issue and provide a more secure way for users to recover their pages that have been hacked. Additionally, I would like to see Facebook implement measures to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing my personal information in the future.

In conclusion, I am deeply disappointed by this situation and hope that Facebook can take prompt action to address it and provide a more secure way for users to recover their pages."

Additionally, I have experienced censorship of comments and posts by the company, where they remove content without providing any explanation or apology for this action. This censorship is not only harmful to my ability to express my opinions but also undermines the integrity of Facebook's user community.

Moreover, I am concerned about Facebook's use of extreme targeted ads that are not related to anything I have ever posted or commented on on any other platform. This lack of transparency and accountability in their advertising practices raises serious concerns about the company's handling of my personal information and my right to privacy.

Anyway Facebook is so easy to hack. I recently had my account hacked on 122521 and ever since then Ive been trying to reach the facebooks security team. Both by phone and email that is provided and no luck. Whoever stole my Facebook changed the email and everything no matter what I do I cant get it back. So like I said I tried to contact Facebook and no one seems to care. What was supposed to be a fun social media app has turned into a nightmare for me. I use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends far away from me and share pictures of our families. I have never violated any guidelines nor do I post inappropriate context for this to happen has ruined social media for me. I mean who hacks facebooks really its not like you got anything from me just a page with pictures and happy positive posts. But whatever.,"
As a Facebook user, I am frustrated by the ease with which my account has been hacked and the lack of support from Facebook's security team.

I rely on Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends who are far away from me, and sharing pictures of our families is one of the things that makes social media a positive experience for me.

User Story: As a user of the Facebook platform, I am dissatisfied with the company's handling of my account and the lack of due process during suspension.

Goals:

1. To ensure that Facebook provides clear guidelines and consequences for violating its community standards, including specific examples of what constitutes a violation and how it is determined.
2. To improve the account suspension process to include more transparency and due process, so that users are not left in the dark about why their accounts were suspended.
3. To address concerns about BOTs taking over the platform by implementing measures to detect and remove them from the system.
4. To make Facebook a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all users, rather than a platform that is dominated by hate groups or BOTs."

As a user, I would like to request that the app provide me with the ability to gradually learn to hate my friends and family while earning money for a massive corporation.

User Story:

Title: Facebook's Prioritization of Free Thought Over User Privacy and Inclusivity

Description: As a user, I am frustrated by Facebook's lack of consideration for my privacy and the impact it has on my ability to freely express myself. Despite their claim to be a platform that ""connects people,"" Facebook's actions have shown that they are more concerned with promoting their own agenda than ensuring a safe and inclusive environment for all users.

Specifically, I am concerned about the following issues:

* The lack of a chronological timeline feature, which would allow me to see my posts in the order they were created, rather than being buried underneath the latest ones. This creates confusion and frustration, as I feel like I am missing important updates that I might have been interested in.
* Facebook's practice of filtering out friends based on minimum interaction thresholds, which has led to the creation of echo chambers where users only interact with those who share similar beliefs and values. This has resulted in a lack of diverse perspectives and a narrowing of the platform's scope, making it less useful for people who are seeking to engage with different viewpoints.
* The app and website's politically immersed and anti-Israel messaging, which I feel is not only harmful but also discriminatory. I believe that all individuals should be treated equally and with respect, regardless of their political beliefs or background. Facebook's actions have shown that they are more interested in promoting their own agenda than allowing for free thought and inclusivity.

Overall, I am disappointed by Facebook's lack of consideration for my privacy and the negative impact it has on my ability to freely express myself. I hope that the platform will prioritize user privacy and inclusivity in the future, rather than prioritizing their own agenda and promoting harmful stereotypes."

As a former member of Facebook, I have been affected by the company's strict community standards regarding private messaging groups. Specifically, my account has been banned for posting something in a private group, which resulted in my accounts being removed from Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram. This ban was justified based on their ""spying"" concern regarding private chat groups.

I am requesting that the company take immediate action to rectify this situation. Specifically, I would like the following improvements:

1. Provide a more detailed explanation of the reasons for the ban and any evidence supporting it.
2. Offer a way for me to dispute the ban and have my account reinstated.
3. Allow me to appeal the decision and have it reviewed by a higher authority.
4. Consider implementing additional measures to prevent future violations of their community standards.
5. Provide a clear and transparent process for disputing bans and appealing decisions.

Title: Constantly Mutes Activists' Voices, Poor Privacy Violations, and Racism on Platform

As a user of the platform, I am horrified by the constant mute of activist voices on the service. Despite my attempts to bring attention to alleged community standards violations, the moderators consistently silence me with vague warnings and muting. This not only hinders my ability to contribute meaningfully but also creates a hostile environment for activists who seek to promote social change.

Furthermore, the platform's handling of accusations of racism is inadequate. While it blocks and warns those who spread hate speech, it fails to address the systemic issues that allow such harmful content to persist on the platform. This lack of accountability enables racist behavior and allows it to thrive on the site.

Unfortunately, the service's overall performance is subpar. It violates my privacy in numerous ways and generally disappoints me with its poor design and functionality. Despite my disappointment with the platform, I cannot give it a perfect score due to the serious issues outlined above."

As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated by several persistent issues with the app's performance on various devices and operating systems. Specifically, I have observed:

* Video resets every time I rotate my screen, which is extremely disruptive to my viewing experience.
* Opening Facebook kills my background audio, which makes it difficult to engage in conversations with others while listening to music.
* There is no dark mode on the iPad, which makes it difficult for users who prefer a more muted experience.

Given these issues, I would like to request improvements to the following areas:

1. Address video rotation bugs: It is unacceptable that the app's video feature causes resets every time I rotate my screen. The developers should prioritize this issue and ensure it is resolved as soon as possible.
2. Fix background audio issues: Opening Facebook should not kill my background audio, making it difficult to engage in conversations with others while listening to music. This issue should be addressed by the developers and fixed as quickly as possible.
3. Implement dark mode for iPad: The lack of a dark mode on the iPad is frustrating for users who prefer a more muted experience. The developers should prioritize this issue and add a dark mode option to the app to cater to users with such preferences.
4. Increase transparency: It is important that the company makes it clear that the data we provide to Facebook for free will be used by them. They should make it more transparent about how their data is used and what steps they take to protect user privacy.
5. Provide more detailed bug reports: If the developers receive a report of a bug, they should have a process in place to investigate and address the issue quickly. This includes providing more detail on the steps to reproduce the bug and a timeline for when it was fixed.
6. Prioritize user experience: The app's performance on various devices and operating systems is subpar. The developers should prioritize this issue and ensure that the app works well across different platforms with minimal bugs.

Facebook then requested additional information from me, including a license and photo of myself holding up a date and filming the video they requested. Despite providing all of this information, I have yet to receive any response or access to my account, despite it having been 5 months since the request. My dead father's posts and photos were stored on Facebook, and I am very upset and annoyed that the platform was able to steal my personal information without my consent.

Furthermore, I have noticed that the platform has been censuring anyone who does not align with their agenda, which I find unacceptable and makes me question the platform's trustworthiness. I believe that Facebook should prioritize protecting its users' personal information and not engage in censorship of dissenting voices."

One would think with data collection Facebook would at least, send me ads Im interested in. The Marketplace  is useless.

Bad app, very bad app.","
As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated with the following issues:

* Too many irrelevant ads being displayed on my feed, which are completely unrelated to my interests.
* The Marketplace is useless and has limited options for buying or selling items.
* Many groups on the platform are filled with angry individuals who share similar complaints without any useful discussion or solutions.
* Children are still posting about their food choices on the app, which has become a source of distraction and frustration.

Overall, I believe Facebook is not meeting my expectations as a user. The ads are annoying, the Marketplace is unhelpful, and the groups are filled with negativity. This is a bad app that needs to be improved."

As a user of Meta, I am disappointed by the company's failure to prioritize user privacy and security. The application that I have been using has a poor design and lacks any considerations for user privacy. It seems like the company is more focused on creating childish apps rather than designing secure and private applications for their users.

Specifically, I would like to see the following improvements:

* Better privacy controls: The application should have stronger privacy controls to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
* Secure data storage: The application should use secure data storage mechanisms to protect user data from cyber threats.
* Transparency: The company should be more transparent about their data collection and usage practices, and provide users with clear information about what data is being collected and how it is used.
* User consent: The application should obtain explicit consent from users before collecting or using any personal data.
* Data protection regulations compliance: The application should comply with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, etc.

Overall, I believe that Meta has a responsibility to prioritize user privacy and security, and their failure to do so is unacceptable."

As a user, I am frustrated with the current state of affairs and feel that my rights as an individual are being violated. I demand that you provide me with a more accurate representation of reality and stop suppressing my voice. I also want to express my concern about the potential consequences of your actions on the environment and society as a whole.

User Story:
As a user, I am looking for a platform that allows me to share my thoughts and ideas freely without fear of suppression or censorship. I want to be able to contribute to the conversation and have my voice heard, but I also want to ensure that my contributions are not suppressed or censored by the platform.

Goals:

* Ensure that all users have the freedom to share their thoughts and ideas without fear of suppression or censorship.
* Provide a platform for open and honest communication, where users can express their opinions and contribute to the conversation.
* Offer tools and features that promote transparency and accountability, allowing users to track and report any instances of suppression or censorship.

Improvements:

* Increase transparency around moderation decisions by providing clear guidelines and processes for reporting and addressing content issues.
* Implement a system for tracking and reporting content that is deemed to be harmful, offensive, or discriminatory.
* Provide users with tools and features that allow them to easily report and block individuals who are engaging in suppression or censorship.
* Offer alternative channels for users to express their opinions and contributions, such as through comments or messaging systems that are not moderated.

Consequences:

* If the platform does not address concerns around suppression or censorship, users may choose to leave or seek out alternative platforms where their voices can be heard without fear of retribution.
* The lack of transparency and accountability in moderation decisions could lead to a loss of trust and confidence in the platform, potentially harming its reputation and user base.

Overall, I believe that it is important for the platform to prioritize freedom of expression and open communication, while also taking steps to ensure that any harmful or discriminatory content is addressed and prevented from spreading. By providing clear guidelines and processes for reporting and addressing content issues, as well as offering alternative channels for users to express their opinions, the platform can help create a safe and inclusive environment where all voices are heard."

Too many ads. Every time I log in, I just want to close it and deal with it later. And the ads are just useless, not even slightly interesting. I find myself spending less and less time on your platform. Stop trying to pretend you actually care about privacy or connecting people.","
As a user of Facebook, I am disappointed in the changes made to the platform. Specifically, the number of ads has increased significantly, making it difficult for me to use the platform without feeling overwhelmed. The ads themselves are also not very interesting, and I find myself spending less and less time on the platform.

I have been a user of Facebook for many years and have always appreciated its ability to connect people with others who share similar interests. However, in recent months, the platform has become increasingly cluttered and overwhelming, with an abundance of ads that are not very engaging or relevant to my life.

One of the biggest issues I face is the sheer number of ads that are displayed on the platform. While I understand that advertisers want to reach as many people as possible, it becomes increasingly difficult to navigate through the endless stream of ads that seem to clog up the feed. This has made it difficult for me to use Facebook without feeling overwhelmed and frustrated.

Furthermore, I find that the ads are not very interesting or relevant to my life. They often feel like they are trying to sell something to me, rather than presenting a genuine opportunity for connection or engagement. This makes it difficult for me to see the value in using Facebook and has led me to spend less and less time on the platform.

In addition to these issues, I have also noticed that the platform has become more focused on collecting data and selling it to advertisers rather than prioritizing user privacy and safety. This has led to a decrease in my sense of security when using the platform, as I feel like my personal information is being used for profit without my consent.

Overall, while Facebook has always had its flaws, these recent changes have made it difficult for me to use the platform without feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. I hope that Facebook will take steps to address these issues and prioritize user privacy and safety."

2. Privacy issues: The app's constant request for access to my phone number and other personal information raises serious privacy concerns. I do not want my personal data being collected or shared without my consent.
3. Spying behavior: The app's tendency to monitor and track my activity, even when I am not using it, is unacceptable. This creates a sense of constant surveillance and mistrust, which can negatively impact my overall experience with the app.

As a user of the app, I am frustrated with the banning system and would like to see improvements in place to address my concerns. Specifically, I would like to request the following:

1. More transparent banning criteria: Currently, the app relies on private data for banning decisions, which can lead to unjustified bans. I would like to see more transparency around the criteria used for banning and the ability to appeal these decisions.
2. Improved moderation team: The current moderation team may not be adequately addressing my concerns about banning. I would like to see a more robust and responsive moderation team that can provide assistance and support in resolving issues related to bans.
3. Enhanced appeal process: Currently, there is no clear or easy-to-follow process for appealing bans. I would like to see a more user-friendly appeal process that provides adequate resources and support for users who have been wrongfully banned.
4. Addressing the issue of male chest showing working out: This has happened multiple times, and it is frustrating and upsetting to be banned for sharing something that I believe is appropriate and harmless. I would like to see a more nuanced approach to content moderation that takes into account individual perspectives and experiences.
5. Improved reporting mechanism: The app's reporting mechanism can sometimes be unreliable or slow in addressing issues related to bans. I would like to see improvements in place to ensure that reports are thoroughly investigated and acted upon promptly."

As a user of Facebook, I am disappointed by the changes made to the platform. In the past, it was a versatile tool that allowed me to connect with friends, family, and like-minded individuals. However, over time, the platform has become more focused on political advertising and social media influencers, which has led to a decline in the number of users who are actively engaged with the platform.

One specific issue I have is with the removal of certain groups that I had been a part of. The ""green thumb"" group was a great resource for me to connect with other gardening enthusiasts, but it suddenly disappeared one day without any explanation or warning. Similarly, the ""gymnastics parents"" group, which I had also been a part of, vanished without a trace.

Furthermore, the platform's algorithm has made it more difficult for me to find and connect with people who share my interests and values. When I try to search for groups or pages related to gardening or gymnastics, I get flooded with political ads and nonsensical pages that have nothing to do with what I am looking for.

As a result, I am feeling less engaged with Facebook and more frustrated by its changes over time.

As a user, I am frustrated with the way Facebook handles reporting violations and consequences for users. Over the past few months, I have been subjected to two consecutive 30-day bans without any explanation or recourse. This has caused significant disruption to my ability to use the platform as it is a crucial tool for me to connect with friends and family while also staying informed about current events.

Furthermore, I have noticed that Facebook has a problem with scammers selling fraudulent products on their platform. This is not only harmful to users but also causes financial losses for businesses that rely on the platform to sell their goods and services. However, despite these clear violations of Facebook's terms of service, I have been met with silence from the company when I have tried to report them.

Additionally, I find it disturbing that when I post about politics or COVID19, I am subjected to heavy criticism and even bans from using the platform. This is unacceptable and shows a lack of respect for users' free speech and privacy.

Overall, I believe that Facebook needs to take concrete steps to address these issues and provide more transparency and accountability in their handling of user violations.

User Story:

As a user, I want the ability to access the core features of the app and desktop site through a mobile browser without experiencing any issues or restrictions. The current situation where Facebook is punishing users with 0 stars by refusing to serve users with the same basic features when using a mobile phone browser is unacceptable and should be rectified immediately.

My facebook has two different linked accounts. Unfortunately it doesnt have my mobile number linked so it made it even worse to recover my account. I recently got my i phone 8 replaced because the screen of my older phone broke completely which meant my phone still worked but the screen didnt which gave me no acess to the phone so i had to replace it to another i phone 8. Everything transfered smoothly from one phone to another. Except when i tried to log in it logged me in but facebook didnt recognize the browser of my brand new replacement phone and told me to use the authentication app which i didnt have access to. I have no other known browsers, u tried resetting my password just to be told i need a code from the facebook code generator but youd need access to your facebook account wich i dont have, facebook cant send me an SMS code because my mobile number isnt linked to it, i filled a report and since facebook doesnt have representatives or costumer service i have to wait an eternity. Im disappointed! I cant even log in with my email and i have two if them linked.","
As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated with the broken 2-factor authentication system on my account. My account has two different linked accounts, but Facebook does not recognize the browser on my brand new replacement phone. Despite trying to log in multiple times, Facebook requires me to use the authentication app, which I do not have access to. The process of resetting my password and attempting to recover my account is time-consuming and frustrating.

I would like to see a solution that allows me to easily recover my account without having to go through multiple steps or wait for long periods of time. Additionally, Facebook should provide more accessible options for sending authentication codes, such as through SMS messages, rather than requiring me to access my Facebook account to receive the code.

Overall, I am disappointed with the broken 2-factor authentication system on my Facebook account and hope that Facebook will address these issues in the future."
