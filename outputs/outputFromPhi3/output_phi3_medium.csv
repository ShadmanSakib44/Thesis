"In addition to being notorious for it39s privacy preaching tactics, selling users data to advertising agencies, Facebook continues it39s downfall into degeneracy by silencing and censoring voices that oppose what39s currently happening in Palestine. freegaza",1,"As a user concerned about privacy, I want the platform/website to stop selling my data to advertising agencies and ensure unbiased representation of perspectives on sensitive topics like Palestine. This is essential for maintaining trust and integrity within the community."
"Ive been trying to get a hold of Facebook because I dont have access to my email but I have a phone number on my account but it wont send me confirmation to my number  all my other apps are logged in to my Facebook account big mistake when I try and get help it gives me things I can do but I did it and it still didnt help me, Facebook can you help me yet?",2,"As a user unable to access their email, I want the ability to receive confirmation messages via phone number for secure login into my account on Facebook. The current self-help options have not resolved this issue for me; further assistance is required."
"Keep getting banned on Facebook for random things, like posting a video of my own daughter walking, and things taken out of context. Even when Facebook review and realise they made a mistake and admit to it and apologise they dont remove that data stored on you so your account is constantly harassed and silenced!! Wont be using it anymore. Im British at Facebook doesnt understand our humour, banter, context  its very annoying we used these apps to stay connected to family, for work, etc.",2,"As a user, I need the ability to appeal my bans on Facebook more effectively and ensure that cleared data is removed from my profile, enabling me to utilize the platform's features without constant harassment or misunderstandings related to humor and contextual content."
"I have been locked out of my account for 2 weeks now after being hacked.  I have contacted Facebook via email relentlessly as Incan not access the help or report section of the platform.  This has caused me to be locked out of my Instagram account as well.
I use the platforms for my business.  My customers think that we have gone out of business.  I spent hours on the phone with my carrier and Apple thinking that something was wrong either with the phone or my carrier.  Its Facebook.   Short codes are coming in from everyone else except them, and they have yet to reply.",2,"As a user whose account has been locked for two weeks due to hacking, I need an efficient solution provided by Facebook to regain access to both my main account and Instagram, as this situation is affecting my business reputation and causing unnecessary communication with my carrier and Apple."
"For all the good Meta does in keeping us connected your company, your leadership and enablers have hooked users to over sharing and over exposure.  In so doing this corporation parasitically intentionally feeds on our unconscious insecurities and shadow via algorithms.  This leads to profound suffering and loss of intimate connections.  This has been my experience.  I believe there deserves to be a class action lawsuit to hold FacebookMeta and its leadership accountability for the incredible political,  societal and individual harm their endless selfish greedy quest for power through data manipulation has wrought.",2,"As a user desiring privacy and intimacy, I want Meta to implement features that protect against oversharing and excessive exposure, while ensuring users are safeguarded from algorithm-driven insecurities leading to distress. This is essential for preserving individual wellbeing and fostering genuine connections."
"The site not only has bias on every topic, but they also dont allow the user any privacy.  They will also censor anything that they dont agree with by flashing it as false when in fact it is not false or by taking down your post.  This is very close to communistnazi behavior and is unacceptable in a free country.",2,"As a user, I want the website to provide objective information on all topics without bias, respect my privacy, and allow open discussions without censorship, ensuring freedom of expression within the platform."
"Facebook is too woke and too much sensoring.   They track you, spy on you, and listen to your convos.  Not to mention the owner contributed millions to stealing election.  It was invented by CIA to watch us",1,"As a user of Facebook, I want improved privacy features that limit tracking and monitoring, ensuring my conversations remain private, while also addressing concerns about political neutrality and ownership transparency."
"I can no longer see who liked my posts. Every time I click on anything it says, no data to show. Im getting unbelievably tired of the updates theyre doing. Im 100 about to go back to MySpace or just delete my Facebook account.",2,"As a user, I want to be able to view who liked my posts so that I can engage with them; currently, it displays 'no data' when I try to click on any post.
The constant updates are frustrating and may cause me to leave the platform or delete my account."
"they monitor EVERYTHING and god forbid they dont agree with you. posts get deleted, they suspend you just about anything. its like a virtual parent that constantly grounds you. i dont even wanna know what they do with my private information.",2,"As a user, I want the platform to monitor activity while ensuring transparency and respecting privacy, so users can understand actions taken on their accounts without feeling overly controlled or having concerns about personal data usage."
Its fine until I go to my profile to see view as and cant look at my pics. I want to be able to look at my pics while in view as because its easier to see what pics and videos of mine that complete strangers can see instead of going through all the pics and videos and changing their individual privacy settings. Can yall fix that please,2,"As a user, I need the ability to view my pictures within the 'view as' feature on my profile so I can easily understand which images are visible to strangers without checking each one's privacy setting individually. This will enhance the overall usability and transparency of my online presence."
"13 years I trusted this site with my life.. only to find out its a data collecting agent of China , pushing communism with its sensoring and false narratives. Big money BIG EVIL .. this app needs to be a mistake of the past.",2,"As a long-term user, I want improved transparency and assurance that my data is safe and not used for unwanted purposes such as pushing specific ideologies or narratives. This will restore trust in the platform's integrity and commitment to usersâ€™ privacy."
"My 15 year old account got hacked and disabled with 2 factor identification on. Facebook reported to have made 116 billion dollars in 2022, but cant afford customer service. I cant recover my account because it was disabled. Facebook also took the liberty to disable my Instagram account. Both disabled with no review. I have never caused in issue on either apps going against there terms and agreements. But I learned a valuable lesson, you dont have any rights to your profiles, pictures, conversations, or business information etc, they can take it away and not give it back at any given time. I have spent many hours researching, sending emails, trying different things etc. to no avail. Thanks Facebook for the complete disappointment and for completely not caring about your customers.",2,"As a long-time user of Facebook and Instagram, allow me to recover my hacked account with two-factor identification enabled while ensuring future protection against unauthorized access. Despite being a valued customer contributing to Facebook's success, I need efficient customer service for recovery assistance and profile data restoration to ensure security and trust in the platform."
"I like to delete andor hide almost everything I have previously seen from FB on a daily basis. Now FB is sending out more of their own garbage than I get from friends. Even though I have clearly requested NO memories, they keep sending more and more. Their reporting system is a waste of time. The buttons on anything they send you dont work and when used just eats up data for hours at a time. I am flooded with Suggested Pages, Friendverseries, Videos, etc and the buttons dont work. The more you report, the more they send.",2,"As a Facebook user, I want an efficient way to declutter my newsfeed by hiding or deleting content from past activities, without being flooded with unnecessary suggested pages and videos. Additionally, I require an effective reporting system that works reliably on sent items. Lastly, I need the ability to control how much 'own' content Facebook sends me daily as per my request."
"It is amazing that Facebook refuses to listen to those who want to use the app but find it a waste of time.  We know you make your money by ads, we could care less.  I have seen thousands of requests to allow users to set how they see their feed, most recent, all comments, etc. but you continue to shovel feed with comments most relevant a unique way to say we will only show you what we want you to see, top posts instead of all posts, again a way of censoring.  This truly is becoming the most inconvenient way of trying to communicate while being the biggest corporation spying on everyones action including what you do on the net that has nothing to do with Facebook.  Their trackers are monetizing every action you do.",2,"As a Facebook user, I want more control over how my feed is displayed, such as viewing by most recent posts or showing all comments, rather than only seeing top posts and relevancy-based content, to personalize my experience without feeling censored."
"This app has completely went downhill !!! NOT A LICK OF FREEDOM LEFT , THEY MONITOR ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFO EVEN WHEN APP ISNT BEING USED. If you try to change your own personal information, you cant until after 30 security questions then it still wont let you. BEYOND POLITICAL AND RACIST. Quick to flag people of color posts but let them be white they can say all the racists things on social media that they want !",2,"As a user, I need an app with greater privacy controls and unbiased content moderation so that my personal information remains secure and diverse perspectives are respected."
Ive had the same Facebook since 2009 somebody hacked me I can I want to go to my page theres so many photos and memories on that page business accounts and now I have no access to get in there I no longer use that email address and cannot change the password somebody hacked into my stuff tonight somebody please point me in the right direction,2,"As a Facebook user, I want to regain access to my hacked account with outdated email credentials so that I can view and preserve my valuable photos, memories, and business accounts. Please guide me on how to securely recover or reset my password."
"If you want your data stolen, download this app. If you want Facebook to spy on you, download this app. If you want your data sold, download this app. Constantly having to change settings so they do not have access to my camera, mic, contacts etc. after each update is just incredibly messed up. Download at your own risk! I will never get back on this app",2,"As a user, I want secure and private usage of the app without unauthorized data sharing or intrusive settings adjustments after updates to ensure my privacy and trust in using the platform."
"Theyve changed the algorithms to make it more difficult for those trying to advertise their business. They censor what information theyd like you to receive. They track every piece of your existence and collect every ounce of information about you, your usage etc. They also access your microphone anytime they see fit.",2,"As a user, I want the platform/website to maintain its new algorithm for advertising but enhance privacy controls to limit data tracking and give me control over my information without accessing my microphone unsolicitedly."
"My Facebook page got hacked and its no way for me to retrieve it. The person took over my whole account. Every time I try to recover it, it goes to his information. He has tried to get money from my friends and he tells them that my son is sick. This is terrible and Facebook need to find a better way in recovering people page. Lori Allen was my Facebook page and now its a man up there. Very disappointed.",2,"As Lori, I want a more secure account recovery process on Facebook so that even if my page gets hacked, it is easier for me to regain access without interference from the hacker's actions."
"I can create an avatar on Instagram and on one of my Facebook business pages but I still cant create one on my personal page where I would actually use it! Please for the love of God, fix this. My app is up to date and Im using an iPhone 12 Pro Max so it isnt my device or the app thats the problem. I have even logged into my account on other peoples phones who have the avatar feature and it works for their account but not mine. What the heck, Facebook?!",2,"As a user, I want to be able to create an avatar on my personal Facebook page so that I can utilize this feature as others are able to do. Despite updating my app and trying different devices, this functionality is still unavailable for me on my account."
"This app spread so much hate and evil. It destroyed families, friendships, relationships. It took jobs and spread racism, sexism, and immorality. It basically fathered all the other toxic apps like tiktok, bigo, and it eventually corrupted fun apps like instagram when it took over. We lost our privacy, we lost freedom and we lost our children in many ways. This app was the worst thing to happen to a global society. Its nothing like myspace was or yahoo which frankly pioneered social media but didnt get recognized for its stolen tech. The ceo allowed hate speech and fake news to destroy the dignity of government office. If less than 1 was possible I would give it",1,"As a user, I desire an app that promotes positivity and respectful interactions without causing harm to relationships or spreading hateful content. It should prioritize privacy, freedom, and offer constructive features for social media platforms while preventing the rise of toxic behavior."
"So apparently I can report being hacked  and block that account but you do nothing ! My friends are sending me pictures of this woman who is showing up on my account and getting messages to borrow money!! Ive tried to recover my account to no avail ask fb for help with unhelpful responses cant say Ill be on much longer as soon as my friends get all my pictures recovered 

Thanks for nothing
Bj jennings
Formally Bernice Jennings 
Who use to be Bernice self till some troll had her killed off thats how good you are",2,"As a user, I want the platform to take action when an account is reported hacked and blocked to prevent unaut**inated messages or content from being sent out. The current lack of response leaves my friends vulnerable to unwanted communications."
Apple made it so permission is needed to track what I look at on other sites yet its pretty obvious youre not following this. I like what Facebook fundamentally stands for originally but its getting to the point where the constant tracking of everything I look at is getting old how about a reply from you explaining this!,2,"As a user, I want Apple's platform/website to enforce stricter privacy measures by genuinely requiring permissions before tracking my activities on other sites. This will provide me with a sense of security and control over my online presence, ensuring that Facebook's commitment to privacy is upheld as it was originally intended."
I cant trust this company after hearing about the censoring and the personal info watching. I immediately deleted the app and deactivated my account. Im sure that wont stop anyone from obtaining my info but it sure makes me feel better knowing its not just out there. Regardless of what privacy settings you have on your account.,2,"As a user, I want to delete my app and deactivate my account when concerned about censorship and data monitoring practices, for increased peace of mind regarding the security of my personal information."
"If I could give 0 zero stars I would or even negative 5 stars better. After being on FakeBook for 13 years and not once being put in FakeMo jail, I ended up in jail 1 week before the 2020 Election because I supported DJT our true President. I never went back and will never go back. Im done being censored or told what to thinksay. Im a true Patriot and Constitutional Conservative, I refuse to be tracked by anyone. Im telling you conservatives that Telegram is there for you. We have everything and more with that great app. As far as Messenger? Theres an app for that too. Its Signal and it is encrypted, safe and private. I can keep track of all my family and friends. Please LEAVE FakeBook Twitter and IG! These apps are all tracking your purchases, marketing to you and influencing your political beliefs. DuckDuckGo is the best search engine and so is Presearch.org look into them! No tracking, no selling your data. Disable Google and all their cookies!",2,"As a true Patriot seeking privacy and freedom from censorship on social media platforms, I want to migrate to Telegram for secure messaging with friends and family, avoiding tracking and political influence while exploring alternative search engines like DuckDuckGo and Presearch.org that respect user data privacy."
"This is without a doubt the worst social media app available. Its losing subscribers at an alarming rate. They spy on you even when your phone is off they are listening.They track your habits and attempt to influence the way you think, what you buy, and even how you vote. Their mind control tactics are synchronized in conjunction with Google and Twitter. So if youre really interested in going full AOC communist I recommend you get the whole package.",2,"As a user seeking privacy, I want an app that respects my data boundaries without tracking habits or influencing decisions, ensuring unbiased information exposure and freedom of choice without unwarranted surveillance."
"The fact that they allow photos of my kids out float out there without my permission is absolutely horrendous. The photos are not from any family members. They are school pictures that allow name labeling without our permission.

Facebook will sell your data to the next highest bidder. Run away from this app.",2,"As a user, I want improved privacy controls so my personal information and family photos aren't shared or sold without my explicit consent on social media platforms like Facebook."
Facebook lies Facebook sells your data Facebook manipulates people by show them false information that fits there agenda but when you actually give out real facts and real studys they ban you for false information or dangerous individuals all facebook does is brainwash the masses and take away our rights. Facebook thinks they are so powerful they can do whatever they want like take away your first amendment rights of freedom of speech because it doesnt fit the narrative Facebook doesnt let you participate in the second amendment you try to show anything related to the second amendment and your banned for violence. Facebook is a evil communist controlled ap used  to takeaway our rights alone with Instagram and Twitter none of them allow the truth to be told all of them want world control,2,"As a user, I need an open platform that respects my freedom of speech by not censoring genuine information or studies; instead of manipulating users with biased narratives. Additionally, platforms should encourage diverse opinions without violating any constitutional rights such as the First and Second Amendment."
One star should be self explanatory after the data breach with no notification from Facebook. Even with changing the privacy settings Im still getting personalized adds even with the settings changed. Only on here until something better comes along.,2,"As a user, I want to have control over my privacy settings so that personalized ads are not displayed when they're turned off; this is important due to recent data breaches and lack of notifications from Facebook about the issue."
"Ive had an account for 13 years and spent thousands in advertising. I have memories on my personal account from people who are no longer alive. My account was hacked and the hackers posted something bad. I even have proof that I was unable to access my account that day. still, Facebook is going to delete my entire account because there is no way to disagree with this decision. The feature is broken. No one answers emails and the whole site is a big advertising piece of junk now.",2,"As a long-term user for over 13 years who has invested in advertising, I need reliable security features on my Facebook account to protect memories with deceased friends, prevent hacking incidents, and ensure prompt email support, rather than being unable to appeal decisions that result in the deletion of valuable content amidst unresponsive service and intrusive ads."
"I rarely to never use this app because of how outdated it is. Facebook as a corporate is garbage, they sensor free speech and fight against human rights advocates. I also loathe them for their data collection policy. Deleting this app.",2,"As a user desiring an up-to-date and respectful platform, I need to have modern features that promote freedom of speech and protect users' privacy, so the current Facebook application should be improved or replaced."
"Why is the Dark mode option not available whenever I switch from my personal profile to my Fan page profile? The white screen on my laptop burns my eyes, I have really sensitive eyes. It makes it difficult to manage my Fan pages due to this mess!",2,"As a user with sensitive eyes, I want the Dark mode option available when switching from my personal profile to my Fan page profile, so that managing fan pages becomes easier and less straining on my eyes."
"Facebook tracks users of google to websites they visit after doing searches evidenced by targeted ads which is an invasion of privacy.  Facebook censors users in various ways removing comments or posts claiming the user removed it when that is not a fact, fact checking opinions opinions are not facts, just users speaking their mind and Facebook doesnt like their opinions, giving warningsputting users in Facebook jail they cant post or comment for a specific period of time, if user disagrees time is extended or suspending users account, even not allowing users the ability to post scientific based evidence of specific topics that they dont like instead of letting users decide for themselves.  Facebook invades users privacy by using certain types of technology Apples Siri for example to listen into personal private conversations evidenced by extremely direct targeted ads that appear on users feed within hours of private conversation.  These ads are not related to anything the user has ever posted or commented about on Facebook, any other social media, or anywhere on the internet.  I or someone I personally know have had actually experienced each and every one of these issues with Facebook.  Apparently Facebook, specifically Mark Zuckerberg, believes he has every right to violate our rights, but we have no rights at all.",2,"As a user, I want improved privacy controls on Facebook that prevent unauthorized tracking and censorship of my posts and comments, ensuring freedom of expression without unwarranted intervention."
"Flagging words, and then auto labeling content as factcheck to be missing content or partially incorrect, does NOT make you look smart.  There is NO WAY you can fact check personal information like the death of family member and say it is wrong when you do not know the family member.  You also cant factcheck a meme or photo.  
The FACT is FB is biased and needs a whole new overhaul!",1,"As a Facebook user, I want an improved fact-checking feature that accurately distinguishes between verifiable facts, personal information, memes, photos, and content requiring an editorial overhaul to ensure unbiased sharing."
"If you tipped Stalinburg upside down the entire CCP would fall out of his pocket. He employs CCP infiltrated staff to fact check and enforces fascism into his company standards by forcibly oppressing any opposition to his leftist, wokeracist, covidmaskvaxx worshipping ideologies. PS  Facebook isnt social media, its a data mining app that will be used against you in the future.",2,"As a user, I want improved content moderation on Stalinburg's platform to prevent extreme political bias and oppression of opposing views, ensuring fairness and neutrality for all users."
Im giving Facebook one star because I cant leave them negative stars lol. Anyway Facebook is so easy to hack. I recently had my account hacked on 122521 and ever since then Ive been trying to reach the facebooks security team. Both by phone and email that is provided and no luck. Whoever stole my Facebook changed the email and everything no matter what I do I cant get it back. So like I said I tried to contact Facebook and no one seems to care. What was supposed to be a fun social media app has turned into a nightmare for me. I use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends far away from me and share pictures of our families. I have never violated any guidelines nor do I post inappropriate context for this to happen has ruined social media for me. I mean who hacks facebooks really its not like you got anything from me just a page with pictures and happy positive posts. But whatever.,2,"As a user, I require improved security measures on Facebook that allow prompt recovery of hacked accounts through efficient communication channels between users and the security team. This feature is essential to restoring trust in the platform's safety for connecting with friends and family while sharing photos and positive posts online."
"Im in Facebook jail without due process. They cant show me where I violated COMMUNITY STANDARDS, so essentially you are at their mercy and all they do is use your data. I now refer to Facebook as HATEBOOK or RACEBOOK. Its an ugly place that BOTs are taking over. Hatebook is going away like AOL and YAHOO",2,"As a user, I want more transparency in the process when my account gets flagged for violating community standards on Facebook so that it doesn't feel like an arbitrary decision based solely on data analysis by bots."
Account was hacked and quickly lockeddisabled. Managed to change password but unable to progress with account recovery as I cant receive any text codes from their system. Looked into contacting customer support.. literally nothing. Some kind of help desk FAQ that is useless.. no phone number or email. Found a number but only a useless robot that led to nothing. Looked and noticed its happening to hundreds.. and scammers are taking advantage or causing it in the first place to pose as customer support to naive consumers. Where they then ask for money or personal information for help. What a joke.,2,"As a user, I want a secure account recovery process that allows me to receive text codes even after my account is locked due to suspicion of hacking, and easily reachable customer support in case of issues with the recovery process."
"Gradually learn to hate your friends and family while earning money for a massive corporation all while receiving nothing in return. Block everyone and everything, give facebook no data, remove all personal information from facebook.",2,"As a Facebook user seeking privacy, I want the ability to block contacts and limit my data sharing with the platform so that I can protect my personal information and feel secure online."
"Been trying to log into my account, but cant because the phone number and email on it are listed on other accounts too. Thank god I can steal several others accounts instead of logging into my own due to lack of support. They offer it, but for businesses and ad purchasers only. Personal accounts get an FAQ style support that solves nothing and only offers rudimentary information based on your needs. Most of which isnt helpful at all.",2,"As a user with multiple accounts listed under one email/phone number, I need the ability to log into my own account easily without relying solely on stealing others' accounts or receiving inadequate FAQ-style support that lacks personalization and fails to address my specific needs."
Its really annoying...I cant use my personal real account...where I have given every proof that facebook community need...than why my account is being disabled??? I recommend everyone not to use facebook...such a bad experience with their new meta...,2,"As a Facebook user seeking to use my verified account, I desire an understanding of the reasons behind its temporary disablement and assurance it will be resolved promptly. This will enhance trust in the platform's management of personal accounts."
Dark mode is missing from the App Settings and Privacy on the iPad Pro..why? It works without problem on my iPhoneit doesnt make sense. This seems to be an issue among many users and seems like it has been going on for some time now and has yet to be fixed. Please fix.,1,"As a user, I want the ability to enable Dark Mode in App Settings and Privacy on iPad Pro because it works without problem on my iPhone but is currently missing on the iPad, an issue faced by many users over a long period. A resolution would be greatly appreciated."
"All the censorship, political and otherwise is despicable.  This program was founded in America but it was founded on the most unAmerican ideals possible.  They will scour and steal every bit of data about you, they will track everything you do, and everywhere you go and in return they will silence and censor your opinions.  They may as well attempt direct enslavement as it is clear they want nothing more than absolute control.  Pathetic, and disgusting behavior unbecoming of the civilized world.",1,"As a user, I want increased privacy protection on this platform so that my data remains secure without any censorship or intrusive tracking of my activities."
"I hate that there is no one to talk to. My account was hacked after having it for 11 years and they changed my recovery email but anytime I sent in my IDs to add a new recovery email it said the information did not match the info on the account you mean the account that someone else probably changed by now!? You mean the thousands of photos dont match my drivers license or any of the past posts?? Like why dont you let me answer my security questions or ask me questions about my account to PROVE that its mine!! I was also told it would be deleted in 30 days if not claimed. I was sad. It relieved because I dont want some stranger to have all of that! And yet its still up.. Ive reported it, had other friends report it. Blocked it. Still upset because that had so many photos and good memories that I cant see anymore. Seriously there has to be more ways to recover an account or someone to talk to please!!",2,"As a long-time user who recently experienced account hacking, I want the platform to provide additional recovery options such as answering security questions or personalized account information verification, so that I can regain access and protect my memories even if my account details have been tampered with."
"With every update it gets worse and worse!!! Why update if it gets worse? Do you even test the app before releasing an update? Seriously like come on! For those in charge of pressuring the developers to release updates to meet demand is absolutely wrong and have no regard to releasing an unfinished or untested update. Marketplace messages is an absolute mess, Facebook searches gives me random results not remotely close to what Im searching and recommending randoms that dont pertain or have no relevance to me. I understand needing advertising for profit but this is ridiculous. Way to sell out! Settings are an absolute nightmare to use and changes made are not shown aside from daily surprises of new features that no one wants! Fix the current problems first and then come up with new features smh. Please reevaluate priorities. I hope devs see this. Supremely disappointed!",2,"As a user, we want Marketplace messages to be organized effectively, Facebook searches to provide relevant results, and settings to be user-friendly; developers should focus on resolving existing issues before introducing new features, ensuring updates are thoroughly tested for quality assurance."
"Dont you just love how a multibillion dollar company doesnt have any support or call center not like it would help, anyways.  

Ive found tons of bugs and ways to track who enters or hacks your account  but no one to address the issues and you lose photos of your mother who passed and birth photos and such you store on Facebook.

Ive tried again later like its been years later.  Funny how easy it is to track contacts these days .",2,"As a user, I need a support system or call center that can help with account security issues so my personal memories stored on the platform are protected and secure from hacks and unauthorized access. Additionally, features for tracking who enters or hacks an account should be more effectively addressed to prevent potential data loss."
"Facebook doesnt care about their users. They refuse to reinstate chronological timelines, filter out friends you dont interact with enough and actively create echo chambers. App is more concerned about pushing Facebook agenda than allowing free thought. Privacy is not a priority.

The app and website are politically immersed and actively encourage antiSemitic and antiIsrael messaging.",2,"As a user, I want Facebook to prioritize reinstating chronological timelines, filtering out less interacted friends, and preventing echo chambers to promote free thought, rather than pushing their own agenda while ensuring privacy concerns are addressed. Additionally, the platform should maintain political neutrality and discourage any form of hate speech or messages that encourage anti-Semitic and anti-Israel sentiments."
"I feel that I am unfairly being banned from Facebook and messenger. I was hacked and FB immediately blocked me and said I would probably be banned.    
I use Facebook to keep in touch with my children, grandchildren family and military friends all over the U.S.
 I only have one phone number and it has apparently been blocked as well
Can someone please be adult enough to let me know how I can access FB once again.
Grannie",2,"As Grannie, I want a way to regain my Facebook account so that I can maintain communication with my family and military friends across the U.S., despite being unfairly banned due to hacking incidents. The process should ensure accessibility using only one phone number."
"Has become a right wing propaganda machine fueled by profits. No real honest shut down of disinformation. Tracking information we do not want tracked. Instagram has become a market place and is full off bots with to many ads. 
SMH",2,"As a user, I need an unbiased platform that actively combats misinformation and respects my privacy by limiting unwanted tracking. The interface should be free of excessive advertisements and bot interference for a more authentic experience on Instagram."
"Ive been a member of Facebook since the death of my space . I was recently banned for posting something in Messenger in a private group of friends. They removed my accounts form messenger, Facebook and Instagram.  I lost everything. Because of their Community standards of spying on private chat groups . Lost all of my pictures from over a decade as well as logins to third party apps and mobile games  which I invested time and money .  Im Contacting my attorney . This is not the last Facebook will hear from me !",2,"As a long-term Facebook user, I need better clarity on Community Standards regarding private chat group monitoring; otherwise, unexpected account removal can lead to significant personal loss."
"Constantly mutes the voices of activists. No real system to challenge accusations of community standards violations, allows racism on its platform but blocks, warns and mutes the activists who point it out. Awful privacy violations and generally a crap service. 

If I could write this review and give zero stars I would.",1,"As an activist user, we want the platform to implement a fair system for challenging community standards violation accusations while preventing discriminatory behavior, enhancing privacy measures, and improving overall service quality."
"Ive noticed that when I post a status, I can no longer edit it after its posted that option is no longer available. So I cant fix an error or add a photo or change anything once its posted. This is ridiculous and annoying. I can still edit privacy, trash the post, archive it, but the edit post option is no longer there. Ugh. Why update the app if there are more glitches and nonsensical changes like removing an edit post option.",2,"As a user of this platform, I want to be able to edit my status posts even after they have been posted so that I can fix errors or add photos without hassle. The current inability to do so is frustrating and counterproductive."
Looks like Facebook is tracking every move I make even though I stated and turned off all tracing and tracking procedure that telling me to do but still being tracked off Facebook even on safari they can trace every move I do. And there is no freedom of speech or an opinion all censored,2,"As a user, I want the ability to turn off all tracking features completely on Facebook so my movements are not recorded while using Safari, ensuring my privacy and freedom of expression."
"They spy on you Deny free speech Censor opinions, and facts. If you like having your Constitutional rights violated, your information being sold to third parties, liberal propaganda. Being monitored by over sensitive nazis then fascistbook is for you.",2,"As a user who values privacy and freedom of expression, I want the platform to stop monitoring my activities, censoring opinions, and selling data. The website should respect users' constitutional rights and provide an unbiased environment free from extreme ideologies."
So I think its suspicious that whenever I have Facebook installed on my phone the apps that I use the most stop working. The zuck also made it so he can spy on what you search on other apps so he can sell your information. So it doesnt surprise me that he disables other apps so youre forced to use Facebook now that everyone else is leaving it.,2,"As a user, I want increased privacy controls and reduced third-party app interference when using popular applications with Facebook installed on my phone to enhance trustworthiness and security."
"im guessing they have such a monopoly on social media that the company and developers have nearly no incentive to fix anything. ive had the same exact bugs persist across devices an major OS updates.

This ensures a well-functioning app with minimal bugs for an enjoyable experience."
Is the app incredibly glitchy even though it really shouldnt be? Yes. Will Facebook steal all data they could possibly obtain and sell it without your consent? Yes. Will they pretend to be a quirky tech company from Cali while actually subverting democracy and monopolizing the internet? Yes. But what else are you gonna do? Find a social media company with integrity? I didnt think so.,2,"As a user, we need an app that is free of glitches for seamless experience, respects our data privacy without unauthorized access and sales to third parties, transparently operates while supporting internet democracy rather than monopolizing it, all underpinned by integrity."

"I am so disappointed with Facebook! I never post anything controversial, yet my Facebook was disabled a little over a week ago and now I received an email that it has been permanently disabled!

FYI, when you create accounts for other apps, dont use your Facebook account to log in to those.",2,"As a user, I need the ability to recover or back up data on Facebook before permanent disabling occurs, ensuring access to my photos, videos, and connected app information is retained and protected against unexpected loss. Additionally, I should have the option of creating accounts for other apps without using my Facebook account as a login method to avoid future risk of losing access."
"This app was okay in the beginning but has become a tyrant in the industry. Constantly gets hacked, sells our info, no privacy or security. My app has been on the fritz again all week causing me to miss business ad posts due to not even being able to see content on my profile. Super tired of Zuckerberg and his complicity in completely disregarding everything its users want. Cant wait for the next big thing to come out. Cause this one is definitely not it anymore!",2,"As a user, I need improved security measures in the app to prevent hacking and unaut

"Far too many ads, which are completely irrelevant to me. One would think with data collection Facebook would at least, send me ads Im interested in. The Marketplace  is useless.

Bad app, very bad app.",2,"As a user seeking personalized ads and efficient marketplace interactions on this platform, I need relevant advertisements based on my interests to enhance my experience rather than irrelevant ones. Additionally, an improvement in the groups' quality is desired for constructive discussions instead of complaints and ensuring child-appropriate content within Marketplace."

"How come we still can39t see our timeline on the iPad?!?!? This should be the most amazing app ever!

UPDATE This company makes me sad, I was hacked last night and there has been zero way to restore my account.

Also, an option should be available to disable the green active dot even when set to leave it off."
Maybe stop infringing on peoples rights and if youre going to correct someone use factual information. This is the most politically biased crock of s i have ever seen in my life.

I do remember better days for Facebook. A time when it acted as versatile tool that could both monitor the kids and look for a used garden tools. Now its political  advertising and old people looking to mingle. The groups of Facebook are gone. For some reason the green thumb group just vanished one day.

Additionally, the ability to access Facebook pages through different browsers must function correctly as expected."
"They take no accountability for the real life consequences of their inactions to moderate the content that is posted to the site. App endlessly plays mindless videos to mesmerize you into wasting time on the app. Its worse than watching TV.

I used to be skeptical of the people who said that Facebook is greedy and super unethical, but its fairly evident now that it may be true.",2,"As a user, I need Facebook to take accountability for moderating content on their site so there are fewer negative real-life consequences. Additionally, as an app user, I want the application to avoid mindless video playback and offer more engaging features instead of encouraging excessive time wastage like television."

My instagram has been hacked rather easily. the same account is linked to my facebook but for some reason i cannot unlink the instagram  which i no longer have access to from my facebook account which i do have access to.

But god forbid you post anything about politics or COVID19 and theyll be all over you.  Facebook is run by crooks.",2,"As a frequent user of Facebook, I want improved recourse options when my account faces unjustified bans so that I can continue using the platform effectively without fear of losing access unfairly. Additionally, there should be proper action against scammers selling fraudulent products to protect other users and maintain trust in the marketplace."
Im not downloading the app. and facebook decided to punish us by refusing to serve users with the same basic features that are apart of the app and desktop sites by removing them when using a mobile phone browser. 0 stars. Do not recommend. Horrible development,2,"As a user, I need Facebook to provide consistent features across all platforms including the mobile browser to ensure seamless experience without limitations imposed on basic functionalities present in apps and desktop sites."
"I hate this app. All of the casual advertisements popping up after having a private conversation in person about it is a violation of my privacy.

Additionally, I expect fair moderation across all topics and removal of explicit spam videos in private community pages following reports with video and photo evidence. This will enhance my overall experience on the app."
"Facebook has a Broken 2 Factor Authentication System. My facebook has two different linked accounts. Unfortunately it doesnt have my mobile number linked so it made it even worse to recover my account. I recently got my i phone 8 replaced because the screen of my older phone broke completely which meant my phone still worked but the screen didnt which gave me no acess to the phone so i had to replace it to another i phone 8. Everything transfered smoothly from one phone to another. Except when i tried to log in it logged me in but facebook didnt recognize the browser of my brand new replacement phone and told me to use the authentication app which i didnt have access to. I have no other known browsers, u tried resetting my password just to be told i need a code from the facebook code generator but youd need access to your facebook account wich i dont have, facebook cant send me an SMS code because my mobile number isnt linked to it, i filled a report and since facebook doesnt have representatives or costumer service i have to wait an eternity. Im disappointed! I cant even log in with my email and i have two if them linked.",2,"As a Facebook user with two different accounts but only one mobile number linked, it is essential for me to improve the recovery process when switching devices without access to the authentication app or receiving SMS codes due to an unlinked mobile number. I expect a smoother login experience on my new device using email credentials."
"My account was stolen from me yesterday, where they changed my phone number email and passwords. I never gave them permission to change anything. 

So if you cant get in, there is no way to access the help center. There is no phone number for customer support. 

All because a friends account was hacked? I had very few friends on this platform. Never befriended anyone I did not know. This program is unsafe and terrible. 

Even the police struggle to access them for support. No wonder people die. Shame on Facebook. This day and age, problems like this are unheard of. Worst programs ever.",2,"As a user, I want enhanced security measures in place to prevent unauthorized account access and ensure that my personal information remains protected at all times. If customer support is not accessible via phone or help center, alternative assistance methods should be provided for users facing difficulties with their accounts."
Fakebook is a social platform set up by the see I A designed to track and monitor every thing you have ever posted and store all your information .

The system should offer live support chat for immediate assistance in such cases."

An advertisement about going to Hawaii after TALKING about it.",1,"As a user, I want the app's advertising system to accurately reflect my interests by recognizing topics from live conversations so that relevant ads like trip destinations are displayed without explicit input on my device."
All the updates that you say to make the app better its a lie you take more control put more ads in and take more of my privacy away!

Additionally, I expect secure sharing practices where my information remains private when interacting with posts from friends."

Yall dont get to appoint a president elect! The electoral college system does! BTW, President Trump is still the sitting president!",2,"As a user of FakeBook, I need my freedom of speech protected and unbiased fact-checking practices so that users can post their opinions without fear of censorship or suppression.

I have very important information on my Facebook for my business account and I cant even get into anything anymore.

I have tried to send in a form of ID and once I did they were able to update my account to the correct email but they stupidly forgot to take the hacked email off and didnt make mine the primary email so the hacker kept getting the password reset emails and kept just changing the passwords because I would even get any emails to do so..

Facebook support is trash! 

If you ever have any issue they will NOT HELP YOU! 
And now that All the Business information I have is out there thanks to Facebook not being secure enough or help at all , I lost everything. And I am STILL trying to get it back.. so if Facebook support sees this.. I really would appreciate it if you would help me for once!

Apple should reconsider allowing this app in their system.",2,"As a user, I need an improved platform that respects my privacy and avoids arbitrary dysfunctionality; therefore, Apple should ensure Facebook adheres to these standards before approval."

Sick of their lies and hiding information that the users deserve to know. They have been stealing and using our information for years IMO illegally and I have finally had enough and deleted their app. They have zero right to hush one side of any information unless it is truly dangerous to another person like a threat.

"Used Facebook for over 12 years and was using it as a mom to keep up with friends and share memories. Then, someone hacked my account at 2am so I wasnt able to respond to the emails about the changes to my account. They changed the email to the account and the password. Facebook has no help chat or a person you can talk to about your account  you are all on your own. So now some horrible hacker has access to pictures and videos of my kids. 
I know the owner of Meta has children, he should be deeply ashamed of his app, its security measures, and its nonexistent help for its users.",2,"As a long-time Facebook user and mother, I want improved account security features to prevent unauthorized access, as well as accessible customer support to resolve any issues regarding my account swiftly. This will ensure the safety of personal content shared on the platform."
"Whats the point of FB now? 

To track everything you do. Read their AUP and Privacy settings. If you even have this app on an iPhone it tracks and records you using your phone camera even when the app isnt open.

Currently, I'm limited to using it through a browser which disrupts my usual workflow since I use marketplace more frequently than Facebook itself."
"Facebook is nothing but a communists tool used to control information. Banning people, making things like female roommate preferred illegal to use, choosing what and what not to ban or promote.

If private companies are limiting access to information based on their preferences, I would like them to be held accountable and for users like me to have the ability to express our dissatisfaction publicly."
Why does Facebook requestrequire a government ID?  And in the fine print suggest they share info for up to 30 days with trusted partners.

One day, things work easily next day were told account is disabled.",2,"As a user, I need an easy and reliable way to update pages other than my personal page on the website, to continue assisting with my volunteer jobs efficiently. The feature needs thorough testing before launch to avoid sudden disabling of accounts."
"The FBMeta platform doesnt create goodwill towards the community.  Instead, privacy breakdowns and lack of transparency to its valued assets, people, are not followed.  This issue is across their entire product line.  They havent proven themselves as trustworthy and dont make themselves accountable internally.",2,"As a user, I need FacebookMeta Platform to improve privacy measures and demonstrate transparency with community members to establish trust within its products."
"I was hacked, FB app ask me to change my password, which I did. Then it said I wasnt old enough to have a Facebook, Ive had my acct longer than the minimum age. Two days later I get an email requesting my age verification documents, which I sent. Been more than 4 months, still no access! Cant contact them in anyway, horrible customer service!",2,"As a user, I expect Facebook to have secure features that protect against unauthorized account access and timely resolution of issues such as age verification problems through efficient customer support channels."
My account was hacked and there is literally ZERO way of contacting Facebook about all of my information being taken etc. its been several days now and nothing. I even tried to make a new account and I cant even do that. I get an error message every single time.,2,"As a user, I need a secure method to recover my hacked Facebook account or create a new one without encountering persistent errors, with the assurance of contact for further assistance."
"Facebook is becoming granny app type of thing, if I can give zero, I would. Their privacy setting is horrible and they try to keep it alive by trying to connect it to other apps. Facebook as a company will be on the decline, sooner that Later no morals or principals. Hope Apple will be ready to fill the void.",1,"As a user concerned about privacy, I need improved settings and fewer cross-app connections so that my data remains secure while using Facebook."
"Facebook is terrible. Fact checkers fact check everything, even if its a video and they do say whatever the fact checkers say they are not doing. Censorship is terrible. And the privacy settings are dangerous.",2,"As a user concerned about censorship and privacy, I want more transparent content moderation that respects different forms of media without undue restrictions, and safer privacy controls to protect my information on Facebook."
All the updates that you say to make the app better its a lie you take more control put more ads in and take more of my privacy away! It scares me when a friend post something and when I go to read it a popup comes up from what they posted using my name that the southern party should not know and asking me to join! Did it weeks ago its review and its still happening liar liar pants on fire and theyre getting away with it,2,"As a user, I need the app to respect privacy by preventing pop-ups from friends' posts using my name for political campaigns. Additionally, I desire less intrusive advertising and greater transparency regarding claimed updates that enhance the platform. The current practices of increased ads and reduced privacy are concerning and not as promised in reviews."
"they keep deleting my review because it calls them out on their bigotry. how dare i tell the truth, right? facebook has an option to report hate speech but ALL reported hate speech doesnt go against their community standards. they also do nothing about spam and do NOT protect your privacy. 

facebook, ill leave this TRUTHFUL review as often as i need to. stop trying to save face. theres a reason you went from 4.5 stars to 2.2 stars in just a month.",2,"As a user on Facebook, I want my honest reviews about their platform's handling of hate speech and privacy issues to remain visible, so that truth prevails and they can improve community standards. Their current deletion actions undermine transparency and trustworthiness."
"Ever wondered how advertisers know what youre thinking about? Well, thats because they actively listen to you. Yep. You read that right. The microphone access you give both of these companies work seamlessly together to piece a profile catered specifically to your preferences. They analyze what you say and then pump that into your feed. Its sick. Targeted advertising shouldnt be a clause in some vague terms amp conditions nobody ever reads. On top of that they censor everything and anything that challenges their constituents over at Washington. Im serious, this platform has been compromised for a while. I dont use Facebook at all except for when I need to call someone. Everything else will just dumb you down, like its already been proven to do so.",2,"As a user seeking privacy, I want my conversations not to be used by advertisers or platforms to create targeted profiles without explicit consent and censorship of information challenging platform policies should be transparent and reasonable."
"Facebook app is completely invasive to your personalprivate life. You are better off logging on through your web browser. The app is like giving up all privacy and Mark Zuckerburg is a liar, thief and crook.",2,"As a user desiring privacy, I want an option in the Facebook app that limits data sharing or allows me to log in via a web browser interface to maintain my personal information's privacy. This would help mite concerns over giving up complete privacy on mobile platforms."
Facebook is starting to get flooded with scammers. At least 10 of my friends were scammed. Then the scammers with the persons page to scam someone else for money. Meaning if you had a personal convo with your friend the scammer has access to everything you said.,2,"As a Facebook user, I want improved security measures to prevent scammers from creating fake profiles and accessing my private conversations, thus protecting my friends' connections from being exploited for financial fraud."
Found spyware Im pretty familiar with hacking .. its Chinese and its in everybodys Facebook .. was curious if I was the only one so I hacked multiple accounts .. Facebook is allowing China to access every Americans information even if Facebook app is uninstalled the spyware remains on your device .. just a warning before I expose Zuckerberg,2,"As a user, I want an assurance of privacy and security, ensuring that my data isn't accessible or compromised by external entities such as Chinese hackers through Facebook. The platform must not retain any spyware even after the app is uninstalled from devices."
I dont like the censoring they impose. I dont like the updates that deviously steal personal data to pad their profits. I also dont like how theyve turned their facial recognitiontagging into something to be used against us.,2,"As a user, I would prefer if the platform respected my privacy by avoiding censorship and not secretly acquiring personal data for profit, while ensuring facial recognition tagging is safe from misuse."
"Interesting how even after doing everything in the Facebook settings to eliminate sponsored posts, I start seeing ads on the app within hours of using a navigation app, opening a YouTube link from Facebook, or even just searching for a place on Google and just putting in a general area instead of allowing it to use my location. The ask app not to track pop up is purely cosmetic and the fact that it does it anyway is clearly a violation of Apples terms.",2,"As a user, I expect ads to be prevented when using Facebook settings, but still encounter sponsored posts within hours due to cross-app interactions or general searches on other platforms like Google. The app should respect my privacy preferences and not show intrusive pop-up tracking requests as it violates Apple's terms."
"I recently took a trip to Europe and made about 4 posts and 1 live video. Days later all of the sudden my posts were deleted even on some that people are tagged in. The photos are shown in my photos but my posts were deleted from my profile page. However, you can see the posts in the profile of the people who were tagged except my profile. I get notifications of comments and likes of the posts I just cant see it if I click on the post notification. I have to goto the people who were tagged in order for me to see my own post! The live video remained on my profile page. This is a personal account by the way.",1,"As an active user, I want to consistently view and interact with all of my posts and comments notifications, including those involving other users' profiles, ensuring seamless visibility across the platform for better engagement experience."
"Ive had no access through the app for months now, Ive re set my password, I cant go on messenger or anything  guys please . Help .. I just want to send funny stuff to my old grandpa who refuses to use her phone number, Im tired of endlessly fighting against this loop of errors",1,"As a user, I need reliable access and functionality through the app's features like messenger for sending messages to relatives. Despite multiple password resets, persistent errors have prevented usage for months, hindering communication with my non-tech savvy grandpa. Assistance is urgently needed to restore uninterrupted service."
"Im always reporting scammers, accounts with nudity pics, fake accounts and false information. You fools never take down the accounts or limit the accounts for going against community standards.

One day you all will be YouTube pop pop with the Glock Glock.

I removed the app and I am not getting back on data abuse book.",2,"As a user, I want reliable removal of reported scammers, fake accounts, nudity, and false information to maintain community standards and trustworthiness in the platform. The website should address reports promptly without any delay or oversight."
"Facebook is actively suppressing points of view they do not agree with or that dont meet there agenda which is a direct violation of the 1st amendment.  They also make billions selling your personal data, while they actively indoctrinate you.  This app is the cause of a lot of the worlds issues.  Why do people who helped create it not use it and forbid their children from doing the same.",1,"As a user, I want Facebook to respect diverse viewpoints without suppression or bias to ensure free speech compliance with the First Amendment, while also maintaining privacy standards to prevent personal data exploitation for commercial gain."
"Fakebook is SO CORRUPT, they REFUSE TO DO THE SLIGHTEST THING TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS.

That GRIFTER, ZUCKERBERG, didnt even INVENT Facebook!
DARPA DID it as LIFELOG.
Its a U.S. Government PsyOp to gather and collate YOUR PERSONAL AND PRIVATE DATA.

I KNOW ITS YUGE, BUT USE IT AT YOUR PERIL!",2,"As a user desiring privacy on Fakebook, implement stronger data protection features to ensure personal and private information is not exploited by the platform for government surveillance purposes."
"This used to be a platform to connect and share but it is clear now that the algorithm is also disruptive with constant unnecessary ads and invasion of privacy. The censorship is dystopian in every sense now so what is the point of sharing even factual information from a credible source?  I wouldnt even rate this a one star, its just that bad.",2,"As a user seeking to connect and share through an engaging platform, I desire reduced disruption by intrusive ads and privacy concerns. Additionally, the censorship should be minimized for authentic interactions with factual information from credible sources. The experience needs improvement beyond current one-star levels."
"Useless app! Got tired of censorship, fake news and self appointed fact checkers that make sure lies and deep state agenda rein. So I decided to down load all of MY data and go through their throughly numerous steps to completely delete my account. Done!... not so fast, my wife on FB tells me Im still on there, active months later. Facebook is using my identity. Run away from this app, it is pure evil.",1,"As a user dissatisfied with censorship and fake news, I want to be able to delete all of my data and account on Facebook completely so that the platform ceases using my identity as advertised. However, after following numerous steps for deletion, my account remains active months later which is causing concern and distress among my family members."
"Ive been on FB ever since it was released I love the new features theyve added over the years, not a fan of them selling peoples data amp information.... but now some features on the iPhone app dont work anymore...marketplace doesnt work, it just shows a blank screen. Then when you message someone from marketplace, your chats dont show up in messenger....its really annoying. You have to find the market place post then click See conversation. Thats the only way you can see the chats",2,"As an experienced Facebook user, I wish for improved functionality of the Marketplace and Messenger features on the iPhone app to ensure seamless communication and transactions between users without needing to navigate through different posts."

Im not saying other websites dont do the same, but Facebook goes farther and acts more entitled than any other groupcompany I can think of.",2,"As a Facebook user concerned about privacy, I want to ensure that my personal data isn't exploited for financial gain by implementing robust security measures and transparent data usage policies."
"im a new upcoming artist and i posted one of my songs on facebook and i tagged like 30 people in it.  Facebook decided that im not me and someones using my account, so they locked it. i couldnt log myself back in cause i no longer have access to that number. when i. clicked on try another way, the only way is by number. no email. nothing. i tried all night. still cant get in it.",1,"As an emerging artist with a locked Facebook account mistakenly identified as impersonated, I need a secure and accessible method to regain access that does not solely rely on phone numbers or emails when these are unavailable. This would allow me to manage my music sharing effectively without unnecessary obstacles."
"From selling our info, to tricking us, lying to us, and manipulating what we see and say, Facebook has done nothing to protect their customers.  The platform is a joke.  Remember the commercials they made apologizing to us after they made billions off our data??? Facebook will get what it deserves one day.",2,"As a user concerned about privacy on Facebook, we need enhanced protection for personal information and transparency in how our data is used, as the current practices of selling info and manipulating content have eroded trust. We expect more accountability from Facebook's side."
"Obviously it goes without saying the sketchyness of this company in my opinion, most notably the censoring and biasing of information. My stories would get flagged all the time because it didnt agree with them haha. Wouldnt recommend or use this app or any of its products at all.",2,"As a user, I want to express diverse opinions without fear of censorship so that my experiences and viewpoints are accurately represented on the platform."
"Besides the annoying repetitive ads, major major major privacy invasion! Why would you want Fb to see your offline activity? Sounds psychotic to me! They can see everything outside the usage of app such as all private conversations, calls, bank apps, etc. It is a NO for me, mind boggling to say the least.",2,"As a user, I desire increased privacy controls on social media platforms, limiting access to my offline activities like private messages and financial transactions outside app usage. This is important as it prevents intrusive data gathering practices that can feel invasive or 'psychotic'."
"Anyone who thinks that FB is our public square is sadly mistaken. FB is boosting and deboosting content based on an agenda  theyre just using us. Delete the app and stop letting them make themselves rich off of harvested data!!! Enter via a browser, with FB blockers if you must",2,"As a Facebook user concerned about privacy and bias in content curation, I want to ensure that my interactions are not being manipulated for agendas. I require tools like ad-blockers and alternative access methods to maintain control over the platform's influence on me. It is also vital that we stop allowing them from profiting off our data without just compensation."
"The app is trash. Not only is it violently unstable, riddled with bugs, and dark mode still broken after weeks, it gargles resources for lunch and chugs battery life.

Oh and it gives Facebook yet another way to invasively track you, creeping into your phones permissions and invasively gathering website data even when you dont use the app. Turning off this setting requires around nine clicks, I counted. And you have to reset turning off that setting after a major app update or it just turns itself back on.

And Facebook is one of the worst companies in the world. Humanity is their commodity and they buy and sell your online identity. Delete the app and delete your account.",2,"As a user, I want the app to be stable without bugs or resource issues, so that my device's battery life isn't adversely affected while using it, along with an easier process for disabling permissions tracking by Facebook."
I have been a facebook customer for several years and recently had my account hacked. I have reached out so many times to have this corrected without result. I have decided that it is a poor application especially given that they can take your information and do whatever they want with it!,2,"As an experienced Facebook user, I need enhanced security measures on my account after experiencing multiple hacking incidents, so I can confidently share information without fear of unauthorized access."
"you are no longer able to restrict profiles eventhough the option is there if you jump through enough hoops, BUT you get an error when you try to add someone to the list. It used to be simply on the persons profile just as ""remove friend"" is. Next we will be unable to remove friends and unable to delete accounts with error messages for each. Just a shame Going back to MYSPACE!!!",1,"As a user, I want to restrict profiles effectively without encountering errors when adding or removing people from my list, maintain current functionality like the 'remove friend' feature on profiles, and be able to delete accounts without receiving error messages, to ensure seamless use of the platform."
"My account was hacked and the support line was absolutely no help whatsoever. I was accused of posting something against their standards of child sexual exploitation and unable to get access back to my account. Lost over 10 years of photos and memories. To top it off, I created a new Facebook and after 1 day theyve prohibited me from liking, commenting, or posting.",2,"As a user, I need the platform's support team to efficiently assist in regaining access to my account without unjust accusations and loss of data, ensuring secure and fair handling of incidents related to content guidelines on both Facebook and new accounts created thereafter."
From their censorship to their use of your private information Facebook is an echo chamber of whatever they want you to hear. Repeatedly blocking and censoring anything that doesnt fit their agenda. What a joke! byefacebook,2,"As a user, I desire a platform where my opinions are not censored or manipulated so I can express freely without the fear of being blocked. The platform should respect and protect my private information instead of using it for its own interests. This will create an environment that encourages open dialogue rather than echoing specific agendas."
Its been 2 weeks and I am STILL not getting notifications when someone posts on my personal posts. I am also not getting notifications from my business page now either until I actually switch over. Garbage app. Please fix!!,2,"As a user, I want to receive notifications immediately when someone interacts with my personal or business posts for timely engagement and communication. The current delay issue should be resolved on both personal and business pages seamlessly without requiring manual switching."
"They havent changed much when it comes to privacy, anyone can still share your pics. They dont prevent online bullying. They let people manage local groups that dont even live in the target area. There is no customer support so dont bother trying to reach out to anyone because there is no one to reach out to. I tried to think of something positive I could say about Facebook but nothing comes to mind its just a waste of time. And I also believe that Facebook starts conflicts because they think your value is based on how many likes you get in life just to make you feel inadequate. I cant tell you how many times Ive deleted this stupid app thinking itd be different or better in some way after two years but nope Facebook still does one thing thats consistent, disappoint.",1,"As a user concerned about privacy and online safety, we need an improved system to control photo sharing and prevent bullying on the platform, with active customer support, so that our personal information is protected while using the website. Additionally, there should be checks in place for local groups' eligibility within target areas to maintain relevance and quality of content shared."
Someone hacked my account and changed all of the log in criteria. When I followed facebooks recovery steps which included submitting a copy of my photo ID I was told they still couldnt verify my identity so my account was basically just gone forever.,2,"As a user, I want to recover access to my hacked account by verifying my identity through submission of valid identification documents without losing the account permanently."
"I reported that my account was hacked no one helped. Might as well shutdown Facebook for not helping people like me with our accounts that are being hacked. And people using our photos on other accounts, and using our personal info. even when our pages are on private. ",2,"As a user whose account has been compromised and unsupported by the platform team, I want Facebook to enhance its security measures and customer support for resolving hacking incidents promptly to ensure users' privacy is protected against unauthorized access and misuse of personal information."
"Looks like the app doesnt recognize my current password when Im prompted to login again to access my account info.  And Im hesitant to logout of the app completely and back in again to try to reset this for fear Ill be locked out of the app until this bug is fixed!

FYI, I did change my password via the website a few months ago, so the app may be recognizing the old password.",2,"As a user, I want the app to recognize and accept updated passwords when prompted for login, so that I can access my account information without fear of being locked out due to potential bugs. This update should reflect changes made on the website as well."
"I have had this facebook account for 14 years with loads of memories on it. I have been hacked for the last 3 months and the person changed the email address, and added a code generator so that I would not be able to get access to it. I have submitted my ID 4 times with no success, and have tried to submit and report the issue, but every time it just tells me that it could not process my request. Facebook should have somewhere we can actually communicate with humans so this wouldnt be an issue. Wish I had access to all my memories.",2,"As a longtime user of Facebook, I want to securely regain control over my hacked account and recover my cherished memories by having the option to communicate directly with human support personnel when facing technical issues that automated systems cannot resolve effectively."
Facebook is abusing its platform to silence and censor voices. Its unbelievable! Mark needs to go back to start and stop using his platform for his political agendas. Also protect peoples privacy instead of abusing it without their permissions.,2,"As a user, I want Facebook to prioritize free expression over political influence while respecting my privacy and not censoring diverse voices on the platform."
For the second time as a member of Facebook my Facebook account had been hacked!!!! I have received Facebook messages from over 40 friends about the hack but I am unable to see what the hack says.  I am one of the moderators for a Facebook Page entitled Huntsville Standard Poodles and cannot even access that site!!!,2,"As a frequent user, we would like to implement an enhanced security feature on our platform where users can report suspicious activities such as account hacking attempts. This will ensure quick resolution of reported issues for maintaining trust within the community."
Fact checkers are not real.  They are lying and covering up actual information.   Just because the news doesnt say its true doesnt mean its not true.  Facebook is a joke.  They spy on us and lie.  Delete this communistic loving crap app now!  Down with the fb!!!  Hello FBI,2,"As a user, I want an alternative to Facebook that respects my privacy and provides accurate information verification due to concerns about misinformation and data privacy issues on current platforms."
My account got hacked and it is so hard to contact someone from a tech support to help in anyway. I cant get my account back now because someone changed all of my information. I cant even redownload the Facebook app.,2,"As a user, I want an easier way to reach technical support when my account gets compromised so that assistance can be provided quickly and efficiently, enabling me to regain access to my personal data and re-download necessary apps such as Facebook."
I now have to completely delete the app when logging out. It will not disconnect. Ever. The circular symbol keeps spinning. It will not let me disconnect. I believe it is either uploading or downloading data. I do not have trust. I simply delete the app every single time I use it. Then download the app again. And it is disconnected and opens fine but again I have to delete and redownload. This is very annoying and tedious.,2,"As a user, I want the application to log out properly when closing without requiring constant deletion and reinstallation, as this improves trust in data privacy while saving time on repetitive tasks."
As Facebook is phasing out human support and replacing them with bots this app basically harvests your info and sells it while restricting your account for posting Stewie Griffin memes. F   Dont even buy their metaverse crap gear. Terrible.,1,"As a user, I want the platform to maintain human support instead of bots and ensure my information isn't sold without consent, enabling me to freely post content like Stewie Griffin memes."
"Social media platforms, like Facebook, are poison to your mind. They sell your data and are building a digital profile of you, all the things you like, dislike, hope or wish for, and fear is in your digital profile. Not to mention this platform is designed to be addicting so that you keep coming back... Think about the last time that you opened Facebook. Did you make the conscious choice to do it, or are you just doing it by habit? Get off of Facebook and start living your life again.
1 year clean off of Facebook ",2,"As a user desiring more control over personal data, I want enhanced privacy options on social media platforms like Facebook that prevent the creation of detailed digital profiles based on my preferences and fears to ensure my information is not sold or exploited. Additionally, features aimed at reducing addictive behaviors would be beneficial to help users regain control over their time spent online.

"The scrolling feature is acting really off the past couple of days. I even deleted the app and redownloaded it. I have the most up to date iOS. It scrolls whacky like you are being remotely hacked. The app isnt acting right. The FB app behaves like right as your phone dies things start acting delayed and reallllly slow or superrrrr sped up. . . That is how the scrolling feature is acting on the FB app, and nothing else on my phone behaves this way. It is just the FB app when you scroll in your news feed. 

FIX THIS!",2,"As a Facebook user, I want the scrolling functionality to be fixed because it has been malfunctioning for days despite reinstallation of the app and having updated iOS, with no other apps experiencing such issues. This will ensure smooth navigation on my news feed without erratic speeds that feel like remote hacking incidents."
Facebook generates its incomprehensibly massive revenue off of the account holders. The account holders own the personal data within the account. Common decency in business practice would uphold the priority of a strong symbiosis between the two. This is not the operating practice of this company. Unethical business practice is the dismal reality the account holders are left to face. And share holders are likely not far behind.,2,"As a Facebook user, I expect my personal data within my account to be respected and protected for mutual benefit, ensuring fair practices that prioritize both our interests. Currently, this balance is lacking, leading to discomfort among users and potential concerns for shareholders as well."
"Ive been getting error fetching data errors every 20 seconds. I cant even use the app anymore. Ive tried all trouble shooting options. My last profile was hacked and no one responded to my emails about it, so I assume Ill have to make another profile again if this error doesnt stop on its own.",1,"As a user, I want an improved data fetching process with reduced errors to enhance app usability without creating a new profile due to persistent issues."
"Facebook used to be cool then it went to trash as everyone realized its gov started and owned,then it helped the horrible outcome of our elections, and overall we all need to hop off it and goto FreeTalk45 for less policing and freedom to say what you want on your stuff. No biometric data needed. You shouldnt have to add personal Information to an app just to use it.",2,"As a user seeking privacy, I want to engage in open discussions without mandatory personal information or biometric data, hence transitioning from Facebook to FreeTalk45 for reduced policing and enhanced freedom of expression."
"Im tired of being harassed, silenced, put in timeout for having an opinion. Im tired of not being able to love my country, President. God. Im embarrassed Facebook is even part of America! Not to mention they stalk you, listen in on your phone when you arent even using the app. Last night my roommate asked me where I got my runner rug, never did I search runner rugs, but yet the next morning Facebook is sending me runner rug ads! Facebook is a HUGE INVASION OF PRIVACY",2,"As a user, I want to express opinions without facing harassment or being silenced, and have my privacy protected from invasive practices like targeted advertisements. It's important that my experience on platforms such as Facebook respects my personal boundaries and reflects American values of freedom of speech and privacy."
"Facebook uses their power to censor posts and hide commentsposts related to topics aka PALESTINE that go against their prozionist, terrorist loving narratives. They willingly hide our posts, prevent us from sharing, and will go so far to delete postsstoriescomments and blame it on a bug. The Zionism shows. The racism shows. The prochildren murder lovers shows. The antisemitism shows. Dont use this app. Youll be happier without it. 

Respect for Apple for shutting down your money hungry privacy stealing scam.",1,"As a user, I want Facebook to treat all content fairly and avoid bias-based censorship so that diverse topics like Palestine can be freely shared and discussed on the platform without deletion or false bug accusations. Additionally, respect for Apple's decision in shutting down privacy concerns should be acknowledged."
My Facebook has been repeatedly hacked these past few weeks. Im convinced FB has something to do with it. Only way theyre allowing me to unlock my account is to send a full photo of my Government issued ID. Ughh no! Fb doesnt need my physical address and other info thats on my drivers license. What happened to email and text confirmations?? Out the door,2,"As a Facebook user, I want secure methods for regaining access to my account without exposing sensitive information such as physical addresses from my Government-issued ID, allowing options like email or text confirmation instead. This is because current procedures leave me vulnerable and expose private details unnecessarily."
"Their updates have made it awkward to use. If you want to respond to a comment, you have to go out of the way to do so. The algorithm is poorly managed, theyll penalize you claiming it goes against their Community Standards when in reality, youve done nothing wrong. You cant get ahold of anyone to report any issues with the platform. It obviously politically motivated and biased, not too mention they wont stop bothering you about their personal agendas such as vaccination information that doesnt provide information at all. I wont recommend this app to anyone.",2,"As a user, I need a more intuitive interface for easier interaction without confusion from poor algorithm management and biased content delivery; also, an efficient support system should be available for reporting platform issues. Additionally, political neutrality is crucial in the information presented on the platform."
FB will do anything they can to get all information on you and sell it. They make it impossibly difficult and confusing to change your privacy settings. Its laid out that way so most people especially the older crowd cant figure out. Much better social media apps out there. Use something else! FB is dead!!,2,"As a user, I need clear and easy-to-use privacy settings on Facebook's platform to manage my information sharing effectively. The current complex interface hinders me from controlling my data, causing dissatisfaction with the service compared to other social media apps which are more intuitive for all age groups."
"My phone contact list was stolen without my approval !!! 
My friend whos on my contact list bought a product and i was advertised the same product on the next day! Hows that possible if i never searched for such a product and my friend doesnt have a Facebook account! And I didnt even open my Facebook account or messenger for months!! Facebook is the only social app i have on my phone. 
and this happened many times. even my phone   number was shared without permission with advertisers who called me. 
I fear this app is a spying tool on peoples privacy. 
Do Not Install this App.",2,"As a user, I want to ensure that my contact list and personal information are securely handled by the platform so that they are not used without my consent for advertising or shared with third parties, preserving my privacy on social media platforms like Facebook."
It has become increasingly obvious that it is virtually impossible to use the FB app and not have them tracking everything you do even when the app isnt open and youre signed out. There is little doubt in my mind the CIA is directly involved with Zuckerberg and Facebook and it was developed specifically as a tool to track people and collect data.,2,"As a user, I want increased privacy controls on the FB app so that even when signed out or not actively using the app, my activities aren't continuously tracked. This will enhance trust in the platform without implying any external involvement."
"I dont like that Facebook collects our data and personalizes ads because it makes me look at more things to buy. Can we turn that feature off? I feel like its invasive. Also, there should be a way that we can pin important messages in groupchats on fb messenger.",2,"As a Facebook user concerned about privacy and customization: ""I would like the ability to disable personalized ads based on my data. Additionally, I need a feature to pin essential messages within group chats on FB Messenger for easy accessibility."""
"Lots of crashes being reported, never got an respond back, and crushes still there. Lot of fake accounts sending spam, and none of them was deleted after reports. Always answer its not harmful. Yes, if someone follow their link and loose money and personal information, its not harmful for Facebook but their standards do not care about you. 
Last one I was banned about Kyle and court ruled that he did nothing wrong. But Facebook thinks different way, court no matter to Facebook representatives, they strike you for 7 days if you support different option than Facebook",1,"As a user on this platform, I need reliable system stability with minimal crashes and prompt responses to issues reported. The feature of deleting fake accounts after reports should be improved, along with better protection against spam. Additionally, there needs to be consistency in enforcing community standards that respect the rulings of external courts over arbitrary bans based on differing opinions."
"Facebook used to be about community and sharing. All it is now is a glorified data miner for your data and they are making billions off of you. You give them your soul and they give your soul to others. 

Its become nothing more than mindless tv with advertisements everywhere. All eyes are on you and ears and location and likes and dislikes, etc. 

Facebook needs to be illegal. Its practices are.",2,"As a user, I want Facebook to prioritize community and sharing over data mining for profitability, ensuring the platform's features focus on fostering genuine connections while respecting privacy."
My profile was hacked about a month ago. My email and password were changed so I wasnt able to get back into it. I was notified by email that this happened and followed a link to prove my identity. I submitted my personal information to this link and waited for them to confirm. After 48 hours they confirmed my ID and sent me a new password and a link to follow. It did not work. I emailed Facebook security to tell them it wasnt working and have not received a response in a very long time. I have contacted them now 3 times by email. I still have not received a response. I wish there was a phone number I could call to expedite this process. I am extremely dissatisfied with their service.

"Listen, I know we all know about cookies and how the entire Internet is selling our information for profit all the time, but Facebook is the worst for it.

"Facebook has become the network of choice for the Democratic Socialist Party. They push an agenda of misinformation and only allow for just one side of a conversation. That one side is that of the Democratic Socialist Party. If the view is not in their, Facebook, best interest then they, Facebook, will censor those views. Facebook doesnt allow for a fair and equitable distribution of information so its members can make an informed decision on their own. If I couldve given a lower rating than 1 star I would have! So if you wish to have every post censored and even have ALL OF YOUR PRIVATE MESSAGES READ AND CENSORED. Then by all means download this tracking app and have your life made public! If you like being able to separate your public from private life get MeWe and Parlor apps!",1,"As a user, I need Facebook to allow fair representation of diverse perspectives in my network for the Democratic Socialist Party, without censoring differing views or having all messages read."
Facebook turns people into products. They manipulate algorithms to spoon feed certain ideologies and to suppress others. All while making BILLIONS as they collect and sell every bit of personal information you provide. Youre literally just a human battery in the Matrix when you use Facebook. And free speech on the platform is highly suppressed. Theyre too busy catering to their woke agenda. Dont expect their alleged community standards team to be anything close to reasonable if youre not a full blown anarchy loving communist who hates America. It should be renamed community DOUBLE standards team. Youre better off deleting the app and watching how much better life can be when you dont have a 247 megaphone of actual disinformation doing everything that it can to control your perception of reality. Good luck and God bless. May the awakening continue...,2,"As a Facebook user seeking unbiased information, I want the platform to treat all users equally without suppressing or promoting certain ideologies for profit. The community standards team should be fair in moderating content regardless of personal beliefs. Additionally, privacy and protection of personal data are crucial features that need improvement on this platform."
"The weak security allowed my account to be hacked. The Facebook folks that dont exist locked down my account and probably will elimininate by the account, just that there is no one to talk to they make no investigation and I end up loosing all my pictures, friends and memories saved there.

"I wouldnt want my information been sold and also Facebook doesnt check for fact checkers wether they are capable of judging without a biases. Its like 1 person researching all this information about everything which is too much for one person to handle.

Up until yesterday I was always able to edit posts I made on personal pages from my phone on the FB app.  Today cannot. I can only edit posts if I use the desktop version on my cell phone browser or from the computer. Using the FB app I cannot edit anything. In fact when you click those 3 buttons in top right even what you see if different. What the heck Facebook?  I even reported issue.,2,"As a user, I want to be able to edit posts on my personal pages from my phone using the FB app, with consistent functionality and appearance as seen in the desktop version or cell phone browser."
"I was hacked back in April, and lost 10 years of memories and pictures and everything and tried so hard to get back into my account and its impossible to communicate with anybody from Facebook. It pretty much runs itself. Mark is a genius. But now Im trying to reset up accounts and I cant remember the password and when it says try another way its still asks for your password. Now I just want to set up a whole new account but Im debating as to whether or not I should even bother. What a pain in the butt and I could see that from the reviews theres a lot of other people that dont like Facebook either.",2,"As a user, reset my forgotten password on Facebook without any support, enabling me to regain access to my account and its content easily. This should be effortless for users who have previously been hacked or faced similar issues."
For some time Facebook fact check had been branding various posts as misleading info such as screen shots from CDC website or WHO directly. When pushed to remove or explain why the complaint gets no response and to date fake check still blurts post,2,"As a user, I want Facebook's fact-check system to respond with explanations when flagging posts as misleading so that I can understand the reason behind their decision. Additionally, there should be accuracy in identifying genuine posts versus false information."
On a pretty large but still limited data plan and havent hit the cap almost ever. Get a warning that Im close so I check whats going on. I see within the last 25 days FB has used 6G of data.

I know it was my fault but I wasnt thinking ! Its so easy for someone to scam you and then try and scam your family and friends ! Facebook doesnt care either unless you buy an oculus !

They collect your data and dont care about you .,2,"As a user, I need improved security features to prevent unaut vice account takeover and scam attempts on Facebook's platform, as well as enhanced privacy measures that prioritize users over profit-driven practices."
"Facebook deleted an account that was hacked that I owned for 15 years. Multiple attempts to deactivate have left with nothing because there is NOTHING you can do. And since you are not paying for the app they dont care. Everyone who has ever used this app knows that they make money off of you one way or another. But for me, 15 years of memories, 2 biz pages and an IG account hacked and gone no content I ever posted is in any group or community. Its theft of ideas, memories relationships because they choose not to help. Then they blame the lack of customer service in covid. It is sad how intertwined we have become with this format and yet they have no responsibility in what they have created.",1,"As a longtime Facebook user, I require assistance in restoring access to my hacked account that has been active for 15 years, including business pages and an Instagram profile, despite multiple deactivation attempts proving unsuccessful. The platform should prioritize resolving such issues, as customer satisfaction is vital considering the revenue generated from user engagement."

This helps foster trust and prevents deceptive practices."
Facebook is silencing people and deleting their post. Their loyalty was never to their customers. The privacy is something to be concerned with. As well as if you would like to write and spread awareness about a humanitarian issue think agian before using Facebook. Because theyll delete your posts if the government told them to.,2,"As a user, I want improved transparency regarding content moderation from Facebook so that my posts remain unaffected even when addressed on sensitive issues. This enhances trust in their commitment to users' privacy and freedom of expression."
Facebook blocked me from marketing my legal businesses. They have censored free speech. They violate your privacy and sell your data . Some even say it's a CIA operative. Huge data collection facilities in Utah,2,"As a user, I want to advertise my legal business on Facebook without being unfairly blocked or having my content censored, while ensuring that my privacy is protected and data usage is transparent."
In the last 6 months Facebook business page has become a big hassle. I cant toggle back and forth from my personal page easily.  Every function has become difficult to use.

Ive honestly given up on social media because of all the censorship now a days",1,"As a user desiring privacy and freedom from censorship, I want to confidently use an app without fearing identity theft or banishment while still feeling secure in my expression."
I really wish family was not on this app so I could get rid of it. The fact that my oculus needs a profile to be used is  stupid. The day Valve releases a standalone VR headset Im jumping ship. Start giving a  about your community and our privacy. Try not to be so evil. We are people.,1,"As a user, I would like the app's community features to respect my privacy without mandating an Oculus profile for usage. Additionally, upon Valve's release of a standalone VR headset, I prefer seamless transition options. Moreover, fostering a positive and understanding community is essential."
This app is awful but thats besides the point. Your information is being sold to the highest bidder and then used against you. Will never use Facebook again. What they are doing amp getting away with is criminal. Delete your accounts unless you want your private info sold to 3rd partys. Bye yuckaburgh ,1,"As a user, I want better privacy controls on the app to prevent selling my personal information to third parties and avoid potential misuse of my data for unethical practices."
Facebook openly and illegally censors posts about human rights violations by the terrorist state which calls itself Israel while simultaneously stealing personal data and information from its users to sell that information at a profit.,2,"As a user, I want Facebook to stop censoring posts about human rights issues related to Israel and protect my personal data from being sold for profit, ensuring transparent privacy practices and equal platform visibility."
Freedom is not just an idea. This app was supposed to be our town square. It has become something evil and ugly where the truth is hidden and lies are promoted.

The world is better without it.,2,"As a user, I want an app that upholds transparency and truth rather than promoting misinformation, as this will restore my trust in the digital platform and encourage informed decision-making."
Read all the privacy and agreements hidden ones too and they steal all your info and sell it. The make it extremely difficult for someone to research what they do with your info.

This way, the platform can provide assurance of data safety to its users while maintaining trustworthiness."
Havent logged on in at least a month. One day the app decided it needed to verify my identity. But when I type in my password it asks me to generate my own code somehow. From what the internet says I need access to the account to use its code generator why it doesnt send a code to my phone to verify is something I dont understand. Greatest thing about Facebook is the complete lack of support. Sell our data all day and night cant even get support for more complex issues it just really shows how much the company DOES NOT CARE.,1,"As a user, I want Facebook's identity verification process to be straightforward by sending an authentication code to my phone instead of forcing me to use their in-app code generator when I can't log into my account. This is because it feels like the platform does not offer adequate support for resolving complex issues which makes users feel unsupported and undervalued."
I would be having a conversation about something and minutes later theres an add about it on my news feed. How can this be legal for them to creep on your conversations??? Its so intrusive. Also why am I not allowed to remove my last name on there? What if Im Concerned about my privacy? You have little to no control what you can do on fb. Why does the cover photo have to be made public so your stalkers can see whos liking your photo? I will be deleting this ASAP and sticking with FaceTime if I want to stay in touch with family. And as much as money fb is making off their ads Im surprised that its dang near impossible to get a hold of an actual live person to resolve an issue. In fact its impossible. What a joke.,2,"As a user, enable me to control the visibility of my name and allow personal conversations privacy on Facebook while maintaining easy accessibility for friends. Additionally, provide clear options for adjusting cover photo privacy settings and improve customer service responsiveness for issue resolution."
Very frustrating. Facebook used to be a place to stay connected with old friendsdistant family etc. now its just adds and poorly managed accounts. Theres no real way to filter out hateful content or other that you dislike. Messenger is a separate app. Everything requires your personal information so it can track you and try to sell you more garbage. Horrible experience.,2,"As a user, I want an improved Facebook platform where I can connect with old friends and distant family by easily filtering out hateful content or unwanted posts, all within one integrated app instead of separate messengers, while maintaining privacy controls that do not require oversharing personal information."
Gathering info on its client base and selling this information to the highest bidder is an evil practice.

Screw these guys,2,"As a user, I want Facebook to protect my privacy by not collecting or selling client data, ensuring secure use without manipulative practices for a more trustworthy social media experience."
"I hate Facebook. I used to love this platform. Im deleting my account that Ive had for over a decade. Id rather lose touch with people than give Facebook and more minute of my time, or allowing them to make another dollar off of my personal data.

Shame!",2,"As a long-time Facebook user, I want better privacy controls and transparency in data usage so that my personal information remains secure and I can decide how it's shared online.

I would really love a Facebook will update their app for the iPad so that I could create an avatar and stop getting the message it needs to be updated. I would also like for Facebook to stop sharing my information when I make it private and for my use only Im tired of seeing ads based off of my age which is a private and all the other crap ads based off of location that is again private. Get your act together Facebook. I want to see my friends posts not ads and posts from three and four days ago.,2,"As an iPad user, I desire an updated Facebook app enabling avatar creation without sharing it for advertising purposes; privacy improvements on data usage in creating targeted ads based on age or location are needed to see relevant content timely like my friends' posts."
"Facebook please make a feature like Instagram has, for our highlights and stories we have on Facebook we should be able to see who watches our highlights and stories it should show everyone regardless if youre not friends with someone on the app for OUR OWN SAFETY and PRIVACY. Some people have legitimate people that want to hurt them, you guys need to make a feature where we can see who watches our highlights and our story even if we are not friends on Facebook. It shouldnt be anonymous its not fair. People can stock us, and they get protected?? yeah no.",2,"As a Facebook user, I want the ability to view who has viewed my Highlights and Stories, similar to Instagram's feature, regardless of whether we are friends on the platform for enhanced safety and privacy. This should not be anonymous as it is unfair and potentially unsafe."
I finally updated my Facebook to see if it fixed this .. it hasn't. I am unable to share onto my personal page from my photography business page. When i type in my name with  Without  sign.

Most dont!,2,"As a photography business user, I want the ability to share posts directly onto my personal Facebook page from my business page for convenience and increased engagement, which has not been resolved even after updating the app recently."

So frustrating.,2,"As a user, I want the ability to list items effectively across various marketplaces and buy-sell groups, and resolve issues with photo/video uploading on Facebook Messenger by allowing users to adjust settings for access control."

"Facebook is not safe anymore. Nobody can have personal online privacy without local or unknown people placing their force fed unwanted advertising or personal blogging junk on others newsfeeds. Nobody can express themselves and their entitled opinions anymore without someone feeling so offended that they have to cry like a little 5 yr to Facebook admins as if the sky was about to fall on them. Facebooks community standards are nothing but a joke. Whats the purpose of having Facebook, Twitter and so on if one cant enjoy themselves safely and securely?",2,"As a user, I want improved privacy controls on Facebook that prevent unwanted advertising and personal content sharing to protect my online expression without offending others or facing undue scrutiny."

If I hadnt seen that his account was hacked by a random post he didnt make he would have no idea what happened and no way to protect his information.

They deserve less than one star rating. They have gotten to big for their own good. They want to control what we post and see. What we buy by suggesting items they have tracked across apps.

Zero customer service. I worked on my business page for 5 years and was hacked on my personal account and lost complete access to my business page. I had to create a new business page, and facebook wont even let me create a new one! It just keep saying query error. Absolutely disgusting that a company is allowed to have absolutely zero customer service, no live support chat, no phone number, no one to respond to emails, nothing.

Also, if you want people to use Reels more professionally make it so we can choose our own cover photo for the reel cause the ones you all choose are awful. And almost all of my reels are muted with copyright claims. I chose songs from the available library you all have for your users using the Audio function. Why is this happening?! Update this, please!
