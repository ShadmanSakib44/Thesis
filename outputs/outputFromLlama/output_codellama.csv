"In addition to being notorious for it39s privacy preaching tactics, selling users data to advertising agencies, Facebook continues it39s downfall into degeneracy by silencing and censoring voices that oppose what39s currently happening in Palestine. freegaza",1,"As a user of the website, I want to be able to easily share information about Palestinian activism and social media to raise awareness about the issue of Israeli oppression and human rights abuses in Palestine. The ability to add a voice to the conversation by sharing personal experiences and stories will help to amplify the message and bring more attention to the important work being done."
"Ive been trying to get a hold of Facebook because I dont have access to my email but I have a phone number on my account but it wont send me confirmation to my number  all my other apps are logged in to my Facebook account big mistake when I try and get help it gives me things I can do but I did it and it still didnt help me, Facebook can you help me yet?",2,"As a user of the Facebook platform, I am unable to access my email to confirm changes made to my account. Despite having a phone number associated with my account, I have not received any confirmation emails or texts. When I try to get help from Facebook, they provide me with options for what I can do, but these solutions do not resolve the issue of not receiving confirmation emails or texts. I am frustrated because I need to be able to access my email to make changes to my account, and I am unable to do so due to this issue."
"Keep getting banned on Facebook for random things, like posting a video of my own daughter walking, and things taken out of context. Even when Facebook review and realise they made a mistake and admit to it and apologise they dont remove that data stored on you so your account is constantly harassed and silenced!! Wont be using it anymore. Im British at Facebook doesnt understand our humour, banter, context  its very annoying we used these apps to stay connected to family, for work, etc.",2,"As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated with the constant banning of my account due to minor infractions such as posting videos of my own daughter walking or things taken out of context. Even when Facebook admits their mistake and apologizes, they do not remove the data stored on me, which silences my account and prevents me from being able to connect with my family and friends through the platform. I rely heavily on Facebook for staying connected to my loved ones, and its ability to handle these situations poorly is a major hindrance to my use of the site. As a British user, I do not understand the humor or banter that American users take for granted, and find it annoying when these features are not understood by Facebook. As a result, I will no longer be using Facebook as a platform for staying connected with my family and friends."
"I have been locked out of my account for 2 weeks now after being hacked.  I have contacted Facebook via email relentlessly as Incan not access the help or report section of the platform.  This has caused me to be locked out of my Instagram account as well.
I use the platforms for my business.  My customers think that we have gone out of business.  I spent hours on the phone with my carrier and Apple thinking that something was wrong either with the phone or my carrier.  Its Facebook.   Short codes are coming in from everyone else except them, and they have yet to reply.",2,"
As a business owner using social media platforms for my business, I am frustrated when I am locked out of my account due to hacking.  When I try to report the issue via email, I can't access Facebook's help or reporting section.  This causes me to also be locked out of Instagram.  My customers think that we have gone out of business because they are unable to communicate with us on social media.  It has caused me to spend hours on the phone with my carrier and Apple, thinking there is a problem with their systems rather than Facebook's security measures."
"For all the good Meta does in keeping us connected your company, your leadership and enablers have hooked users to over sharing and over exposure.  In so doing this corporation parasitically intentionally feeds on our unconscious insecurities and shadow via algorithms.  This leads to profound suffering and loss of intimate connections.  This has been my experience.  I believe there deserves to be a class action lawsuit to hold FacebookMeta and its leadership accountability for the incredible political,  societal and individual harm their endless selfish greedy quest for power through data manipulation has wrought.",2,"
As a Meta user, I am deeply concerned about the impact of Facebook's algorithms on my personal relationships and connections. Despite the good that Meta has done in keeping us connected, the company's leadership and enablers have intentionally hooked users to over-sharing and over-exposure, leading to parasitic feeding off our unconscious insecurities and shadow via algorithms. This has resulted in profound suffering and loss of intimate connections, which I believe warrant a class action lawsuit against FacebookMeta and its leadership for the harm their endless selfish greed for power through data manipulation has caused."
"The site not only has bias on every topic, but they also dont allow the user any privacy.  They will also censor anything that they dont agree with by flashing it as false when in fact it is not false or by taking down your post.  This is very close to communistnazi behavior and is unacceptable in a free country.",2,"As a user, I am frustrated when I want to express my opinion on certain topics but the platform/website does not allow me to do so due to censorship or bias. I believe that a website should be able to accept all perspectives and opinions without fear of retribution or censorship.

User Story:
As a user, I want the website to allow me to express my opinion on any topic without facing censorship or bias. I want the platform to be able to accept all perspectives and opinions without fear of retribution or censorship. This is important for fostering free and open discourse."
"Facebook is too woke and too much sensoring.   They track you, spy on you, and listen to your convos.  Not to mention the owner contributed millions to stealing election.  It was invented by CIA to watch us",1,"
As a user of Facebook, I am concerned about my privacy and security on the platform. The fact that the company tracks my activities, spies on my conversations, and has been linked to the owner's controversial political actions is unacceptable. I believe that this information should be kept private and not used for any other purpose than to provide a social media service. It is also concerning to learn that the platform was invented by the CIA to watch us, which raises further questions about its intentions and trustworthiness."
"I can no longer see who liked my posts. Every time I click on anything it says, no data to show. Im getting unbelievably tired of the updates theyre doing. Im 100 about to go back to MySpace or just delete my Facebook account.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated by the inability to see who has liked my posts and the lack of data displayed on my feed. The updates provided by Facebook are not helpful and I am considering leaving the platform due to their constant changes and lack of functionality."
"they monitor EVERYTHING and god forbid they dont agree with you. posts get deleted, they suspend you just about anything. its like a virtual parent that constantly grounds you. i dont even wanna know what they do with my private information.",2,"As a user of the platform/website, I want to ensure that my privacy is protected and that I am able to use the site without fear of retribution or monitoring. This includes being able to post content without it being deleted or suspended, and having access to my personal information in case something happens to me."
Its fine until I go to my profile to see view as and cant look at my pics. I want to be able to look at my pics while in view as because its easier to see what pics and videos of mine that complete strangers can see instead of going through all the pics and videos and changing their individual privacy settings. Can yall fix that please,2,"As a user, I want to be able to easily view my photos while in View As mode because it makes it easier for complete strangers to see my photos without having to individually change each photo's privacy settings."
"13 years I trusted this site with my life.. only to find out its a data collecting agent of China , pushing communism with its sensoring and false narratives. Big money BIG EVIL .. this app needs to be a mistake of the past.",2,"As a user who has trusted this website for 13 years, I am deeply concerned about its recent behavior. The website has been acting as a data collecting agent for China and promoting communism through sensors and false narratives. This is a betrayal of the trust that I have placed in it, and it needs to be shut down immediately.

The website's actions are big money and evil, and it should not be allowed to continue deceiving people in this way. It is essential to correct this mistake as soon as possible to prevent further harm."
"My 15 year old account got hacked and disabled with 2 factor identification on. Facebook reported to have made 116 billion dollars in 2022, but cant afford customer service. I cant recover my account because it was disabled. Facebook also took the liberty to disable my Instagram account. Both disabled with no review. I have never caused in issue on either apps going against there terms and agreements. But I learned a valuable lesson, you dont have any rights to your profiles, pictures, conversations, or business information etc, they can take it away and not give it back at any given time. I have spent many hours researching, sending emails, trying different things etc. to no avail. Thanks Facebook for the complete disappointment and for completely not caring about your customers.",2,"
As a user who had their account disabled with 2-factor identification on, I am unable to recover my account despite reporting it to Facebook. Both Facebook and Instagram have taken the liberty to disable my accounts without any review from me. Despite never causing any issues, I learned that I don't have any rights to my profile, pictures, conversations, or business information. I wasted hours researching and trying different solutions, but to no avail. Thank you Facebook for the complete disappointment and for not caring about your customers."
"I like to delete andor hide almost everything I have previously seen from FB on a daily basis. Now FB is sending out more of their own garbage than I get from friends. Even though I have clearly requested NO memories, they keep sending more and more. Their reporting system is a waste of time. The buttons on anything they send you dont work and when used just eats up data for hours at a time. I am flooded with Suggested Pages, Friendverseries, Videos, etc and the buttons dont work. The more you report, the more they send.",2,"
As an user, I want to be able to delete or hide most of my previously seen content on Facebook in order to avoid receiving unnecessary updates. However, despite requesting that no memories are sent to me, Facebook is still sending out a large amount of their own content. The reporting system is also not effective and the buttons provided do not work properly. I am overwhelmed with Suggested Pages, Friend Series, Videos, etc., and the buttons do not work and waste data. The more I report, the more they send."
"It is amazing that Facebook refuses to listen to those who want to use the app but find it a waste of time.  We know you make your money by ads, we could care less.  I have seen thousands of requests to allow users to set how they see their feed, most recent, all comments, etc. but you continue to shovel feed with comments most relevant a unique way to say we will only show you what we want you to see, top posts instead of all posts, again a way of censoring.  This truly is becoming the most inconvenient way of trying to communicate while being the biggest corporation spying on everyones action including what you do on the net that has nothing to do with Facebook.  Their trackers are monetizing every action you do.",2,"
User Story: As a user who is frustrated with the lack of control over their feed on Facebook, I want the ability to set how they see their feed, including options for seeing all comments or only the most recent posts. Additionally, I want the ability to customize the way my feed is displayed to better suit my needs and preferences."
"This app has completely went downhill !!! NOT A LICK OF FREEDOM LEFT , THEY MONITOR ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFO EVEN WHEN APP ISNT BEING USED. If you try to change your own personal information, you cant until after 30 security questions then it still wont let you. BEYOND POLITICAL AND RACIST. Quick to flag people of color posts but let them be white they can say all the racists things on social media that they want !",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated with the platform because it has completely gone downhill. The lack of freedom and personal information monitoring is unacceptable, and the security questions required to change information are overly restrictive. The app's handling of racial discrimination and its quick flagging of people of color's posts is concerning, even when they can say racist things on social media."
Ive had the same Facebook since 2009 somebody hacked me I can I want to go to my page theres so many photos and memories on that page business accounts and now I have no access to get in there I no longer use that email address and cannot change the password somebody hacked into my stuff tonight somebody please point me in the right direction,2,"As a user of Facebook, I want to be able to recover access to my account after it has been compromised. Specifically, I want to be able to log back into my account using my original email address and password, without any issues or complications. Additionally, if possible, I would like the ability to change my password from a non-recoverable one, such as one that was chosen by someone else. This would ensure that my personal information is safe and secure, and that I am able to access my account without any hassle or interference."
"If you want your data stolen, download this app. If you want Facebook to spy on you, download this app. If you want your data sold, download this app. Constantly having to change settings so they do not have access to my camera, mic, contacts etc. after each update is just incredibly messed up. Download at your own risk! I will never get back on this app",2,"As a user, I am frustrated with the constant changes in privacy settings required by the app after each update. This makes it difficult for me to use the app without having to constantly adjust my privacy settings. It would be beneficial if the app could allow users to customize their privacy settings once and have them stick, rather than requiring updates every time there is a new release."
"Theyve changed the algorithms to make it more difficult for those trying to advertise their business. They censor what information theyd like you to receive. They track every piece of your existence and collect every ounce of information about you, your usage etc. They also access your microphone anytime they see fit.",2,"
As a user of the platform/website, I am frustrated by the changes made to the algorithms, which make it more difficult for me to advertise my business. I would like the platform/website to restore the original functionality and allow me to advertise my business without any issues. Additionally, I would like the platform/website to not censor any information that I would like to receive and track my usage and collect every ounce of information about me, including my microphone."
"My Facebook page got hacked and its no way for me to retrieve it. The person took over my whole account. Every time I try to recover it, it goes to his information. He has tried to get money from my friends and he tells them that my son is sick. This is terrible and Facebook need to find a better way in recovering people page. Lori Allen was my Facebook page and now its a man up there. Very disappointed.",2,"As a user, I am extremely disappointed with the recent hack of my Facebook page and the resulting loss of control over it. The person who took over my account has been trying to get money from my friends by claiming that my son is sick, which is not true. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and I hope Facebook can find a better way to recover pages in the future."
"I can create an avatar on Instagram and on one of my Facebook business pages but I still cant create one on my personal page where I would actually use it! Please for the love of God, fix this. My app is up to date and Im using an iPhone 12 Pro Max so it isnt my device or the app thats the problem. I have even logged into my account on other peoples phones who have the avatar feature and it works for their account but not mine. What the heck, Facebook?!",2,"As a user of Instagram, I want to be able to create an avatar on all of my pages (personal, business, and Instagram) so that I can personalize my experience and make sure that my profile looks consistent across all of them. This feature is currently only available on some of my accounts, and it would be a huge improvement if it were available on all of them."
"This app spread so much hate and evil. It destroyed families, friendships, relationships. It took jobs and spread racism, sexism, and immorality. It basically fathered all the other toxic apps like tiktok, bigo, and it eventually corrupted fun apps like instagram when it took over. We lost our privacy, we lost freedom and we lost our children in many ways. This app was the worst thing to happen to a global society. Its nothing like myspace was or yahoo which frankly pioneered social media but didnt get recognized for its stolen tech. The ceo allowed hate speech and fake news to destroy the dignity of government office. If less than 1 was possible I would give it",1,"
As a user, I am disturbed by the negative impact that this app has had on society. It has created harmful environments for its users, including families, friendships, and relationships. It has taken jobs and promoted racism, sexism, and immorality. It has even corrupted other popular apps like TikTok and Instagram. I fear that the app's spread of hate and evil has had a detrimental effect on our privacy, freedom, and children. This app is not only the worst thing to happen to a global society but also an example of why stealing technology and using it for nefarious purposes should be condemned. The CEO's allowance of hate speech and fake news harms the dignity of government offices."
"So apparently I can report being hacked  and block that account but you do nothing ! My friends are sending me pictures of this woman who is showing up on my account and getting messages to borrow money!! Ive tried to recover my account to no avail ask fb for help with unhelpful responses cant say Ill be on much longer as soon as my friends get all my pictures recovered 

Thanks for nothing

Formally Bernice Jennings 
Who use to be Bernice self till some troll had her killed off thats how good you are",2,"As a user, I want to be able to report being hacked and have my account blocked so that I can prevent any further unauthorized access to my account. However, despite my attempts to recover my account, I was unable to do so. This has caused me significant inconvenience and frustration, as well as the threat of identity theft and harassment by this unknown woman.

I have tried reaching out to Facebook for help in recovering my account, but their responses were unhelpful and unsatisfying. I fear that my account may be compromised further if I do not take immediate action to protect myself. As someone who is concerned about my own safety and the security of my online presence, I am disappointed in the lack of support and assistance provided by Facebook in this situation."
Apple made it so permission is needed to track what I look at on other sites yet its pretty obvious youre not following this. I like what Facebook fundamentally stands for originally but its getting to the point where the constant tracking of everything I look at is getting old how about a reply from you explaining this!,2,"As a user, I want to know why I need to give permission for my browsing history on other sites when Apple is not following their own guidelines. It's getting frustrating that Facebook is tracking everything I look at and it's not clear why I need to provide consent for this. I would appreciate a reply from Facebook explaining their reasons for doing this."
I cant trust this company after hearing about the censoring and the personal info watching. I immediately deleted the app and deactivated my account. Im sure that wont stop anyone from obtaining my info but it sure makes me feel better knowing its not just out there. Regardless of what privacy settings you have on your account.,2,"As a user, I want to ensure my personal information is safe and secure when using a platform or website, so that I can trust the company and feel confident in sharing my data. If the company has been accused of censoring users' content or watching their personal information without consent, it would be a major concern for me as a user. I want to make sure that any information I share with the company is kept private and not shared with third parties without my consent."
"If I could give 0 zero stars I would or even negative 5 stars better. After being on FakeBook for 13 years and not once being put in FakeMo jail, I ended up in jail 1 week before the 2020 Election because I supported DJT our true President. I never went back and will never go back. Im done being censored or told what to thinksay. Im a true Patriot and Constitutional Conservative, I refuse to be tracked by anyone. Im telling you conservatives that Telegram is there for you. We have everything and more with that great app. As far as Messenger? Theres an app for that too. Its Signal and it is encrypted, safe and private. I can keep track of all my family and friends. Please LEAVE FakeBook Twitter and IG! These apps are all tracking your purchases, marketing to you and influencing your political beliefs. DuckDuckGo is the best search engine and so is Presearch.org look into them! No tracking, no selling your data. Disable Google and all their cookies!",2,"
As a user of FakeBook for 13 years who never experienced jail time despite not supporting DJT, I want to leave this platform due to its constant censorship and influence over my political beliefs. I will no longer use Facebook or Twitter as they are not secure enough. Instead, I recommend Telegram and Signal apps as alternatives for staying private and secure while maintaining communication with loved ones. I also suggest using DuckDuckGo search engine and Presearch.org to avoid tracking and selling personal data."
"This is without a doubt the worst social media app available. Its losing subscribers at an alarming rate. They spy on you even when your phone is off they are listening.They track your habits and attempt to influence the way you think, what you buy, and even how you vote. Their mind control tactics are synchronized in conjunction with Google and Twitter. So if youre really interested in going full AOC communist I recommend you get the whole package.",2,"As a user of this social media app, I am frustrated by its poor performance, particularly with regards to privacy concerns. I am concerned that the app is monitoring my activities even when my phone is off and is attempting to influence my thoughts, purchases, and voting decisions. The mind control tactics used by the app are unsettling and synchronized with Google and Twitter. To fully experience the AOC communist lifestyle, I recommend getting the whole package."
"The fact that they allow photos of my kids out float out there without my permission is absolutely horrendous. The photos are not from any family members. They are school pictures that allow name labeling without our permission.

Facebook will sell your data to the next highest bidder. Run away from this app.",2,"As a concerned parent, I want to ensure that my children's personal information and photos are kept private and secure on social media platforms like Facebook. The fact that Facebook sells user data to the highest bidder is a major concern for me and I would appreciate it if Facebook took immediate action to prevent this from happening in the future."
Facebook lies Facebook sells your data Facebook manipulates people by show them false information that fits there agenda but when you actually give out real facts and real studys they ban you for false information or dangerous individuals all facebook does is brainwash the masses and take away our rights. Facebook thinks they are so powerful they can do whatever they want like take away your first amendment rights of freedom of speech because it doesnt fit the narrative Facebook doesnt let you participate in the second amendment you try to show anything related to the second amendment and your banned for violence. Facebook is a evil communist controlled ap used  to takeaway our rights alone with Instagram and Twitter none of them allow the truth to be told all of them want world control,2,"
""As a user, I am fed up with Facebook's manipulation of my information and its attempt to brainwash me. They sell my data without my consent and manipulate me with false information that fits their agenda. I want to participate in the second amendment but Facebook bans me for any mention of it. They want world control and are using social media to achieve this. I will not be silenced."""
One star should be self explanatory after the data breach with no notification from Facebook. Even with changing the privacy settings Im still getting personalized adds even with the settings changed. Only on here until something better comes along.,2,"
As a user, I want to receive timely and accurate notifications when my personal information is compromised, so that I can take appropriate measures to protect myself from unauthorized access or misuse.

Functionality: Facebook's notification system for data breaches is not effective in providing timely and accurate updates. Even with changed privacy settings, the platform still displays personalized advertisements, which may compromise my security."
"Ive had an account for 13 years and spent thousands in advertising. I have memories on my personal account from people who are no longer alive. My account was hacked and the hackers posted something bad. I even have proof that I was unable to access my account that day. still, Facebook is going to delete my entire account because there is no way to disagree with this decision. The feature is broken. No one answers emails and the whole site is a big advertising piece of junk now.",2,"
As a user who has had an account for 13 years and spent thousands on advertising, I am frustrated that my account was hacked and the hackers posted something bad about me. Despite evidence that I was unable to access my account at the time of the hack, Facebook is deleting my entire account without providing any explanation or option for me to disagree with this decision. The feature is broken, no one answers emails, and the site is now a big advertising piece of junk."
"I rarely to never use this app because of how outdated it is. Facebook as a corporate is garbage, they sensor free speech and fight against human rights advocates. I also loathe them for their data collection policy. Deleting this app.",2,"As a user, I would like the ability to delete the Facebook app on my device because of its outdated features and poor corporate practices. Specifically, I dislike how the app collects personal information and restricts free speech for human rights advocates."
"Why is the Dark mode option not available whenever I switch from my personal profile to my Fan page profile? The white screen on my laptop burns my eyes, I have really sensitive eyes. It makes it difficult to manage my Fan pages due to this mess!",2,"As a user of Facebook, I want the ability to switch between my personal and Fan Page profiles without issues. Specifically, I want the Dark mode option available whenever I switch from my personal profile to my Fan page profile. This will help me manage my Fan pages with less eye strain on my laptop."
"Facebook tracks users of google to websites they visit after doing searches evidenced by targeted ads which is an invasion of privacy.  Facebook censors users in various ways removing comments or posts claiming the user removed it when that is not a fact, fact checking opinions opinions are not facts, just users speaking their mind and Facebook doesnt like their opinions, giving warningsputting users in Facebook jail they cant post or comment for a specific period of time, if user disagrees time is extended or suspending users account, even not allowing users the ability to post scientific based evidence of specific topics that they dont like instead of letting users decide for themselves.  Facebook invades users privacy by using certain types of technology Apples Siri for example to listen into personal private conversations evidenced by extremely direct targeted ads that appear on users feed within hours of private conversation.  These ads are not related to anything the user has ever posted or commented about on Facebook, any other social media, or anywhere on the internet.  I or someone I personally know have had actually experienced each and every one of these issues with Facebook.  Apparently Facebook, specifically Mark Zuckerberg, believes he has every right to violate our rights, but we have no rights at all.",2,"
User Story: As a user who values their privacy on the internet, I am frustrated by Facebook's invasive tracking and censorship of users, including targeted ads, fact-checking, opinion suppression, jailing, suspension of accounts, and violation of scientific evidence. I want to be able to post and comment freely without fear of retribution or ostracization by Facebook."
"Flagging words, and then auto labeling content as factcheck to be missing content or partially incorrect, does NOT make you look smart.  There is NO WAY you can fact check personal information like the death of family member and say it is wrong when you do not know the family member.  You also cant factcheck a meme or photo.  
The FACT is FB is biased and needs a whole new overhaul!",1,"
As a user, I am frustrated with Facebook's bias and need for an overhaul. Whenever I share personal information about my family, it is not fact-checked properly. This can be harmful as it affects the credibility of my family members who are deceased. Additionally, when I share content that is labeled as a meme or photo, Facebook does not fact-check them. It seems like Facebook doesn't care about fact-checking and is more focused on making money.

User Story:
As a user, I want Facebook to fact-check all content before it is posted, especially personal information about deceased family members. Additionally, I want Facebook to fact-check meme and photo content to avoid spreading false information. This will help improve the credibility of my posts and the overall integrity of the platform."
"If you tipped Stalinburg upside down the entire CCP would fall out of his pocket. He employs CCP infiltrated staff to fact check and enforces fascism into his company standards by forcibly oppressing any opposition to his leftist, wokeracist, covidmaskvaxx worshipping ideologies. PS  Facebook isnt social media, its a data mining app that will be used against you in the future.",2,"
User Story: As a user of the platform, I want to ensure that my personal information and privacy are protected from any potential misuse or exploitation by the company's CCP infiltrated staff who enforce fascist leftist ideologies and oppress any opposition to their worker-acist, covidmaskvaxx worshipping policies."
Im giving Facebook one star because I cant leave them negative stars lol. Anyway Facebook is so easy to hack. I recently had my account hacked on 122521 and ever since then Ive been trying to reach the facebooks security team. Both by phone and email that is provided and no luck. Whoever stole my Facebook changed the email and everything no matter what I do I cant get it back. So like I said I tried to contact Facebook and no one seems to care. What was supposed to be a fun social media app has turned into a nightmare for me. I use Facebook to stay in touch with family and friends far away from me and share pictures of our families. I have never violated any guidelines nor do I post inappropriate context for this to happen has ruined social media for me. I mean who hacks facebooks really its not like you got anything from me just a page with pictures and happy positive posts. But whatever.,2,"As a user of Facebook, I am extremely disappointed with the recent hacking incident on my account. The fact that I was unable to reach out to Facebook's security team and have my account restored has been frustrating and stressful. Despite trying multiple times through phone and email, no one seems to care or provide a solution.

I use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family who are far away from me, as well as to share pictures and happy posts. I never violate any guidelines or post inappropriate content, yet my account has been compromised and I am unable to recover it. The fact that the hacker was able to change my email address makes it even more difficult for me to regain access to my account.

Overall, I am extremely displeased with Facebook's security and customer service, and I fear that other users may also be affected by this incident."
"Im in Facebook jail without due process. They cant show me where I violated COMMUNITY STANDARDS, so essentially you are at their mercy and all they do is use your data. I now refer to Facebook as HATEBOOK or RACEBOOK. Its an ugly place that BOTs are taking over. Hatebook is going away like AOL and YAHOO",2,"
As a user, I want the ability to know where I violated community standards in order to understand why I am being treated as if I am in ""Facebook jail"" without due process. It is frustrating when I feel that the platform has no regard for my privacy and data security, and it is becoming increasingly clear that Hatebook is not a safe or trustworthy place to be online."
Account was hacked and quickly lockeddisabled. Managed to change password but unable to progress with account recovery as I cant receive any text codes from their system. Looked into contacting customer support.. literally nothing. Some kind of help desk FAQ that is useless.. no phone number or email. Found a number but only a useless robot that led to nothing. Looked and noticed its happening to hundreds.. and scammers are taking advantage or causing it in the first place to pose as customer support to naive consumers. Where they then ask for money or personal information for help. What a joke.,2,"As a user, I want to be able to easily recover my account from being hacked and locked out, so that I can regain access to my account without having to resort to expensive services or wait for long periods of time.

I want the customer support team to be responsive and helpful in resolving any issues with my account recovery process, so that I can quickly get back to using my account without feeling frustrated or discouraged.

I want the customer support team to have a clear and easy-to-understand FAQ page that provides helpful information on how to recover an account from being hacked, so that I can find the answers I need quickly and easily.

I want the customer support team to have a real and active customer service representative who is available to assist me in a timely manner, so that I can feel confident that my issue will be resolved quickly and effectively."
"Gradually learn to hate your friends and family while earning money for a massive corporation all while receiving nothing in return. Block everyone and everything, give facebook no data, remove all personal information from facebook.",2,"
As a user, I want to have complete control over my online privacy and the ability to block anyone or anything that I don't want on my social media platform. This includes blocking my friends and family while still earning money for a massive corporation."
"Been trying to log into my account, but cant because the phone number and email on it are listed on other accounts too. Thank god I can steal several others accounts instead of logging into my own due to lack of support. They offer it, but for businesses and ad purchasers only. Personal accounts get an FAQ style support that solves nothing and only offers rudimentary information based on your needs. Most of which isnt helpful at all.",2,"
As a user, I am unable to log into my account because the phone number and email address associated with it are already linked to other accounts. This creates an inconvenience for me as I would like to access my personal information securely and efficiently.

I have tried contacting support but they offer limited assistance for personal users. The FAQ style support does not provide adequate solutions or helpful information that addresses my specific needs. Therefore, I am dissatisfied with the current support system provided by the platform/website."
Its really annoying...I cant use my personal real account...where I have given every proof that facebook community need...than why my account is being disabled??? I recommend everyone not to use facebook...such a bad experience with their new meta...,2,"
As a user, I am frustrated when my account on Facebook is disabled without any explanation or justification. It's especially inconvenient since I have already provided proof that the community needs my account.

Dark mode is missing from the App Settings and Privacy on the iPad Pro..why? It works without problem on my iPhoneit doesnt make sense. This seems to be an issue among many users and seems like it has been going on for some time now and has yet to be fixed. Please fix.,1,"
As a user of this platform, I would like to have the option to use the Dark mode in the App Settings and Privacy on my iPad Pro as it works perfectly on my iPhone. It is frustrating that this issue has not been resolved and causes inconvenience among many users. Please fix this issue to ensure a better user experience."
"All the censorship, political and otherwise is despicable.  This program was founded in America but it was founded on the most unAmerican ideals possible.  They will scour and steal every bit of data about you, they will track everything you do, and everywhere you go and in return they will silence and censor your opinions.  They may as well attempt direct enslavement as it is clear they want nothing more than absolute control.  Pathetic, and disgusting behavior unbecoming of the civilized world.",1,"As a user who values their privacy and autonomy, I am deeply disturbed by the censorship and oppression that has been implemented in this platform. The fact that they are scouring and stealing every bit of data about me, tracking everything I do, and silencing my opinions is unacceptable and a clear violation of my human rights. It is disgusting behavior and unbecoming of the civilized world we live in."
"I hate that there is no one to talk to. My account was hacked after having it for 11 years and they changed my recovery email but anytime I sent in my IDs to add a new recovery email it said the information did not match the info on the account you mean the account that someone else probably changed by now!? You mean the thousands of photos dont match my drivers license or any of the past posts?? Like why dont you let me answer my security questions or ask me questions about my account to PROVE that its mine!! I was also told it would be deleted in 30 days if not claimed. I was sad. It relieved because I dont want some stranger to have all of that! And yet its still up.. Ive reported it, had other friends report it. Blocked it. Still upset because that had so many photos and good memories that I cant see anymore. Seriously there has to be more ways to recover an account or someone to talk to please!!",2,"
As a user who has been affected by the hacking of their account, I am frustrated with the lack of communication and support from the platform. After having my account for 11 years, it was recently hacked and my recovery email was changed without my consent. Despite multiple attempts to add a new recovery email using the old information, the system would not allow it due to what it claimed was an ""incorrect"" match with the current account information.

I am also upset about the loss of all the photos and memories associated with my account, as well as the fact that I was told it would be deleted in 30 days if not claimed. Despite reporting the issue, having other friends report it, and blocking the account, it is still up and accessible to strangers.

I am looking for more communication and support from the platform to help me recover my account and regain access to my personal information and memories. It would be helpful if the platform offered more ways to recover an account or provided a way to verify ownership through additional security questions or contacting the platform's customer support directly."
"With every update it gets worse and worse!!! Why update if it gets worse? Do you even test the app before releasing an update? Seriously like come on! For those in charge of pressuring the developers to release updates to meet demand is absolutely wrong and have no regard to releasing an unfinished or untested update. Marketplace messages is an absolute mess, Facebook searches gives me random results not remotely close to what Im searching and recommending randoms that dont pertain or have no relevance to me. I understand needing advertising for profit but this is ridiculous. Way to sell out! Settings are an absolute nightmare to use and changes made are not shown aside from daily surprises of new features that no one wants! Fix the current problems first and then come up with new features smh. Please reevaluate priorities. I hope devs see this. Supremely disappointed!",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated with the update process on this platform. Every time an update is released, it gets worse and worse. The app's search function is not reliable, and I often receive irrelevant or unrelated results. Additionally, the settings are difficult to navigate and change, leading to frequent surprises in new features that do not align with my needs. I understand the importance of advertising for profit but find this behavior reprehensible. Please reassess your priorities and address these issues before moving forward with any further updates."
"Dont you just love how a multibillion dollar company doesnt have any support or call center not like it would help, anyways.  

Ive found tons of bugs and ways to track who enters or hacks your account  but no one to address the issues and you lose photos of your mother who passed and birth photos and such you store on Facebook.

Ive tried again later like its been years later.  Funny how easy it is to track contacts these days .",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated by the lack of support and call center available for issues with my account on a multibillion-dollar company's platform. I have found numerous bugs in the platform and ways to track who has accessed my account, but no one is addressing the issues. The loss of photos of my mother and birth photos stored on the platform is also causing me distress. I have tried reaching out to the company later on, but it feels like they are not providing adequate support."
"Facebook doesnt care about their users. They refuse to reinstate chronological timelines, filter out friends you dont interact with enough and actively create echo chambers. App is more concerned about pushing Facebook agenda than allowing free thought. Privacy is not a priority.

The app and website are politically immersed and actively encourage antiSemitic and antiIsrael messaging.",2,"
As a user of the app, I am frustrated by Facebook's failure to reinstate chronological timelines, which prioritize free thought over political agenda-driven content. Furthermore, Facebook's algorithm tends to filter out users that don't interact enough with other friends and creates echo chambers. This lack of transparency in their algorithms makes it difficult for me to see the diversity of opinions on the platform.

Moreover, I have noticed that the app and website are heavily politically immersed and actively promote anti-Semitic and pro-Israel messages. As a user who values free speech and open discourse, I find these biases offensive and harmful to my well-being as an individual.

Therefore, I would like Facebook to prioritize transparency in their algorithms, promote diverse perspectives on the platform, and refrain from promoting political bias and hate speech."
"I feel that I am unfairly being banned from Facebook and messenger. I was hacked and FB immediately blocked me and said I would probably be banned.    
I use Facebook to keep in touch with my children, grandchildren family and military friends all over the U.S.
 I only have one phone number and it has apparently been blocked as well
Can someone please be adult enough to let me know how I can access FB once again.
Grannie",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated with the recent ban on my account due to a hacking incident. I rely heavily on Facebook to stay in touch with my children, grandchildren, and military friends across the United States, and I need access to this platform to maintain these connections. I understand that Facebook has taken steps to prevent further hacks, but I feel that I should be able to regain access to my account without facing further bans.

I would greatly appreciate it if someone from Facebook could provide me with information on how I can redeem my account and restore access to the platform.

As a user, I am seeking a solution to regain access to my account and maintain my connections on Facebook."
"Has become a right wing propaganda machine fueled by profits. No real honest shut down of disinformation. Tracking information we do not want tracked. Instagram has become a market place and is full off bots with to many ads. 
SMH",2,"As a user, I am fed up with the constant stream of misinformation on social media platforms like Instagram. It has become a right-wing propaganda machine fueled by profits, with no real honest shutdown of disinformation. I don't want my data to be tracked without my consent and I don't want to see a marketplace full of bots with too many ads.

I would like Instagram to improve its algorithms to better detect and prevent misinformation, and to have more controls over what data is being collected and used. Additionally, I would like to see more transparency in the company's decision-making processes and a shift towards promoting fact-based content."
"Ive been a member of Facebook since the death of my space . I was recently banned for posting something in Messenger in a private group of friends. They removed my accounts form messenger, Facebook and Instagram.  I lost everything. Because of their Community standards of spying on private chat groups . Lost all of my pictures from over a decade as well as logins to third party apps and mobile games  which I invested time and money .  Im Contacting my attorney . This is not the last Facebook will hear from me !",2,"
As a former Facebook member, I am outraged by the company's recent actions. Specifically, I was banned for posting something in a private group of friends, which resulted in the removal of my accounts from Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram. This has caused me significant loss, including the loss of all pictures from over a decade as well as logins to third-party apps and mobile games that I invested time and money in.

I am contacting my attorney regarding this situation, as it is clear that Facebook's Community Standards are not up to par with their other products. This experience has shown me that I will no longer be able to trust Facebook with my personal information.

This is not the last I will hear from me and I look forward to seeing changes made to ensure that users can feel safe using Facebook's platforms without fear of being banned or losing their accounts."
"Constantly mutes the voices of activists. No real system to challenge accusations of community standards violations, allows racism on its platform but blocks, warns and mutes the activists who point it out. Awful privacy violations and generally a crap service. 

If I could write this review and give zero stars I would.",1,"As a user, I am constantly harassed by racist and hateful voices on this platform. There is no real system in place to challenge accusations of community standards violations when these voices are reported. This allows racism to thrive on the platform while silencing those who speak out against it. The platform's privacy violations are also severe, leaving me feeling like my personal information is being used without my consent. Overall, this service is subpar and doesn't live up to its promises of safety and community."
"Ive noticed that when I post a status, I can no longer edit it after its posted that option is no longer available. So I cant fix an error or add a photo or change anything once its posted. This is ridiculous and annoying. I can still edit privacy, trash the post, archive it, but the edit post option is no longer there. Ugh. Why update the app if there are more glitches and nonsensical changes like removing an edit post option.",2,"
As a user, I want to be able to edit my posted status after posting it, so that I can fix any errors or add photos or make other changes to it. However, the ""edit post"" option is no longer available once the status has been posted, which is ridiculous and annoying. This glitch makes it difficult for me to update my status accurately and quickly."
Looks like Facebook is tracking every move I make even though I stated and turned off all tracing and tracking procedure that telling me to do but still being tracked off Facebook even on safari they can trace every move I do. And there is no freedom of speech or an opinion all censored,2,"

User Story:

Title: Control over Privacy Settings

Description: As a user, I want the ability to have control over my privacy settings and not be tracked by the platform without my consent. This includes being able to turn off all tracing and tracking procedures and still be able to use the platform without it tracking my every move. Additionally, I want the ability to express my opinions and share information without fear of censorship or interference from the platform."
"They spy on you Deny free speech Censor opinions, and facts. If you like having your Constitutional rights violated, your information being sold to third parties, liberal propaganda. Being monitored by over sensitive nazis then fascistbook is for you.",2,"As a user who values their freedom and privacy, I am frustrated when I encounter censorship on websites. I do not want to be monitored or have my information sold to third parties without my consent. I believe that free speech and the ability to express oneself should be protected, but I also understand that there may be concerns about safety and security. I would like to see a platform/website that balances these concerns with the need for user privacy and freedom of expression.

Functionality: The website should have features in place to prevent censorship and ensure user privacy, such as encryption for sensitive information and options for users to opt out of data collection. Additionally, it would be helpful to have a clear and transparent policy regarding user data and the use of that data."
So I think its suspicious that whenever I have Facebook installed on my phone the apps that I use the most stop working. The zuck also made it so he can spy on what you search on other apps so he can sell your information. So it doesnt surprise me that he disables other apps so youre forced to use Facebook now that everyone else is leaving it.,2,"
As a user, I am concerned about the functionality of Facebook and how it may be using my data in an unethical manner. Specifically, I find it suspicious that whenever I have Facebook installed on my phone, other apps that I frequently use stop working properly. Additionally, it is concerning to know that Mark Zuckerberg has implemented features that allow him to spy on what I search for on other apps and sell my personal information. It is also disturbing to see that he has disabled other apps in an attempt to force users to rely on Facebook, which I believe many others have already left. As a user, I am seeking a solution to this issue where I can control the data that I share with Facebook and ensure that it is not being used in an unethical manner by the platform's developers."
"im guessing they have such a monopoly on social media that the company and developers have nearly no incentive to fix anything. ive had the same exact bugs persist across devices an major OS updates. 

ones I can recall atm that frustrate me to no end
video resets every time I rotate the screen
opening facebook kills my background audio
no dark mode on ipad not a bug, just a complaint

this company makes billions of the data we provide to them for free, the least they can do is make an app that freaking works well and have their developers on top of keeping the app a pleasant experience with minimal bugs. if you need to hire more developers, then do that",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated by the persistent bugs in the Facebook app on various devices and operating systems. Specifically, I face issues with the video resetting whenever I rotate my screen, opening the app kills my background audio, and there is no dark mode available for the iPad. Despite having such a monopoly on social media, the company has shown little to no interest in fixing these issues or making their app more pleasant to use. It seems they have so many users providing free data that they are not motivated to improve the user experience."
Is the app incredibly glitchy even though it really shouldnt be? Yes. Will Facebook steal all data they could possibly obtain and sell it without your consent? Yes. Will they pretend to be a quirky tech company from Cali while actually subverting democracy and monopolizing the internet? Yes. But what else are you gonna do? Find a social media company with integrity? I didnt think so.,2,"As a user, I am frustrated by the glitchy nature of the app, despite its supposed reputation for being reliable. I also feel that Facebook is inappropriately gathering my personal data without my consent and selling it to other companies. Additionally, I believe that they are intentionally subverting democracy and controlling the internet through their dominance. Despite this, I do not think that finding a social media company with integrity is an option for me."
Was scrolling through my news feed and all of a sudden it sends me a message saying I have to verify my personal info. It asks for a passcode that was sent to my phone only I never received a passcode. I am now locked out.,2,"
As a user, I want to be able to access the information on the website without being locked out due to an error in the verification process.

Functionalities:

* The website should verify personal information accurately and send the passcode only to authorized users.
* The website should provide an easy way for users to retrieve their passcodes if they are lost or forgotten."
"I am so disappointed with Facebook! I never post anything controversial, yet my Facebook was disabled a little over a week ago and now I received an email that it has been permanently disabled! Ive lost all my pictures and videos. Ive also lost access and information to every app that was connected to Facebook. FYI, when you create accounts for other apps, dont use your Facebook account to log in to those.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am extremely disappointed with the platform's recent changes. Despite never posting anything controversial, my account has been permanently disabled after being disabled for less than a week. This has resulted in me losing access to all of my pictures and videos, as well as information to every app that was connected to Facebook. It is unacceptable that I have had to lose this much data and access without any explanation or recourse. As someone who uses Facebook to connect with friends and family, I rely on the platform for communication and organization. I cannot stress enough how important it is for Facebook to restore my account as soon as possible so that I can regain access to all of my information and continue using the platform."
"This app was okay in the beginning but has become a tyrant in the industry. Constantly gets hacked, sells our info, no privacy or security. My app has been on the fritz again all week causing me to miss business ad posts due to not even being able to see content on my profile. Super tired of Zuckerberg and his complicity in completely disregarding everything its users want. Cant wait for the next big thing to come out. Cause this one is definitely not it anymore!",2,"As a user, I want a more secure and private platform that doesn't compromise my privacy and security, so that I can feel confident using it without fear of data breaches or unauthorized access to my information."
I can only use my Facebook App as my business and can no longer get to my personal page. I am not happy about that. Facebook still works fine on my desktop and my laptop so it is definitely the app that is the problem,2,"
As a user of Facebook, I want to be able to access both my personal and business profiles from my phone's Facebook App without any issues or interruptions. However, since implementing the new features, I have noticed that I can only use my Facebook App as my business profile and cannot access my personal page anymore. This is causing me significant inconvenience as I am unable to share updates and connect with friends and family on my personal page."
"I opened my account in 2008. I got a new phone and rye app said it could recognize my device. Wouldnt even accept my password. Sent them my license and picture holding the date and a video they requested. Its been 5 months and still no access to my account and no responses from facebook. Theyve since closed my account. I had all my dead fathers posts and photos on there. Im very upset and annoyed at Facebook. They say they try to protect your information yet they steal yours!!!

Also that censor anyone who doesnt align with their agenda. They cant be trusted.",2,"As a user, I want to have access to my account on Facebook after having opened it in 2008 and not being able to access it for five months because of issues with the recognition of my device and not accepting my password. I also want to have all the posts and photos from my dead father's account on Facebook removed as they are not mine, and I feel violated by their actions. Additionally, I would like to see a change in Facebook's policies regarding protecting user information and against censorship of users who do not align with their agenda."
"Far too many ads, which are completely irrelevant to me. One would think with data collection Facebook would at least, send me ads Im interested in. The Marketplace  is useless. Most of the groups are angry people searching for like minded individuals who will mimic their complaints. And, yes, some children are still posting their food. 

Bad app, very bad app.",2,"As a user of Facebook, I am extremely frustrated with the amount of irrelevant ads that appear on my feed. Despite data collection, I don't see any ads relevant to me or any value in the Marketplace. Most groups are filled with angry people complaining about things, and some children still post their food.

I would like Facebook to improve its advertising algorithm to show me more relevant ads and remove unnecessary noise from my feed. Additionally, I would appreciate if Facebook could address the issues with the Marketplace, such as removing negative groups and providing more resources for users to find helpful information."
"So is Apple! Now they make it so you have to use the apps and not the browsers, easier tracking and spying. Unfortunately so many things and people use FB and other crappy platforms that limit your use and spy on you. Our world is doomed because of this trash and for allowing it to continue you get reap what you sow.",1,"As a concerned user, I want the ability to access my Facebook account using a traditional browser instead of an app, so that I can maintain my privacy and avoid being tracked and spied upon by Meta."
This app is the worse. Its create with the porpoise of tracking you and see what or who you talk with. This type of app it should be often changing of developer and app platform to the people have a little bit mor me of privacy,2,"As a user, I am frustrated with this app because it is not respecting my privacy. It tracks my conversations and interactions on the app without my consent, which violates my trust and privacy. As a result, I would like to request that the developer of this app provide more features for users' privacy, such as giving them more control over who can see their information or making changes to the app's platform regularly to ensure user safety."
"Its worst designed application with zero privacy consideration, randomly engineered app, Sad to say zuckerberg major part of life was on creating amp supporting childish app. Fking zuckerberg for creating many privacy damages.",1,"As a user, I am frustrated by the poor design and lack of privacy considerations of this application. The randomly engineered app is not user-friendly and has created significant privacy concerns. I had high hopes for Facebook, but my expectations were subverted by Zuckerberg's choices. His actions have been a major blow to trust in the platform."
My account was hacked and Facebook deleted it. I lost all the pictures I had of my child. Contacted Facebook and they did absolutely nothing despite the fact that the hacker private messaged me and made legitimate threats to me. Facebook didnt even respond to me.,1,"As a user who experienced a security breach on Facebook, I am frustrated with the platform's handling of my issue. Despite receiving multiple messages from the hacker, Facebook did not take any action against them or provide a satisfactory solution to restore my account and retrieve my deleted content. The lack of response from the platform is unacceptable, especially given the seriousness of the situation and the potential harm that could have been caused to me and my child's privacy.

I expect Facebook to take immediate action against the hacker and ensure the security of all users' accounts on their platform. Additionally, I would like a clear and concise explanation from Facebook regarding what measures they took to prevent similar breaches in the future. The deletion of my account and the loss of my child's pictures are both unacceptable outcomes that should be resolved as soon as possible."
"All you do is silence anyone who speaks against your FAILED narrative, and then badger people by shutting down their accounts which is their source of revenue. I think its time we shut off access to your source of revenue so you can see exactly how it feels! We are DONE letting you mine our data for free! Your dream of smart cities is about to be flushed down el toileto ",2,"As a concerned user, I am upset that the website silences anyone who speaks against their narrative and then shuts down people's accounts which is their source of revenue.

"I keep getting the same spam bots on my Facebook telling me Im the winner, Im reported it and Ive blocked every bot, its the same profile picture on each of the spam bots page. Also Ive been getting notifications from random garage sale groups Im not even apart of",2,"As a user, I would like to have a way to filter out the spam bots that keep showing up on my Facebook page and receiving notifications from unrelated groups. This will help me to stay informed about updates in the groups I am actually interested in while avoiding unnecessary notifications from unknown sources."
"Pictures will not open also

Between the privacy violations, the unjust property theft of any and all content accessed, and now the biased, blatant sensorship Im DONE with Facebook! Uninstalled for good! Facebook has continually and increasingly pushed steps towards invading the users privacy and rights to speech for YEARS now with NOTHING being done to stop it and Im DONE. I wouldnt even be writing this if it werent for the fact that this app DESERVES far more poor ratings.",2,"As a user, I am fed up with Facebook's violations of my privacy and rights to speech. The company has continually pushed steps towards invading my privacy and rights to speech without taking any action to stop it. I have had enough of their biased and blatant sensorship and would like to uninstalled the app for good."
"Seriously Facebook. Your new changes just get worse and worse. Too many ads. Every time I log in, I just want to close it and deal with it later. And the ads are just useless, not even slightly interesting. I find myself spending less and less time on your platform. Stop trying to pretend you actually care about privacy or connecting people.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated with the recent changes that have made my experience worse. The constant stream of ads is getting on my nerves and I find myself spending less time on the platform. My main goal is to have access to my personal information without being bombarded by ads that are not even slightly interesting."
"How come we still can39t see our timeline on the iPad?!?!? This should be the most amazing app ever!

UPDATE This company makes me sad, I was hacked last night and there has been zero way to restore my account. The hackers quickly within an hour changed all my info and added a 3rd party two factor authentication code that prevents me from moving past it . Your company is protecting the hackers and do not care about the actual account holder. Please make this right.",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated because I can't access my timeline on the iPad app. This should be an amazing app, but the inability to see my timeline is a major issue.

Functionality: The ability to view and manage multiple social media platforms within one app would greatly enhance the user experience. The lack of this functionality has been causing me significant inconvenience.

Impact: I am unable to access my timeline, which is essential for staying informed about my personal brand. This has caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety. "
"Facebook has lots of issues even for our safety at this point we are all thinking is mark suckerburgh really help our privacy or just sucking our privacy away by putting our global security at risk with problematic safety concerns 100 but Facebook needs to hear us out and not from mark Zuckerberg immature ideas and fixes to Facebooks interface, algorithms, updates, ect. so Im giving this app and website including Facebook Messenger a one star ",2,"As a user of Facebook, I want the platform to take my concerns about the safety of the platform seriously and provide appropriate solutions for protecting users' privacy."
"This app is horrible. It gives you constant notifications, even when alerts are turned off. The privacy issues and constant spying are despicable.

As a user, I want to be able to control my notifications and privacy settings on this platform/website, so that I am not constantly bombarded with unwanted alerts and can maintain my personal data's security."
Maybe stop infringing on peoples rights and if youre going to correct someone use factual information. This is the most politically biased crock of s i have ever seen in my life. Breaking every law in the books and then telling everyone else theyre wrong just because they dont think the same. Waste of time and they are selling your info anyway.,2,"
As a user, I want to be able to use this platform/website without fear of being infringed upon by its developers.

As a user, I want the option to turn off the ""Recommended Friends"" feature on my Facebook page so that I don't have to see friends who don't follow me or like my posts and don't need to know them. It is an invasion of privacy and takes away my control over who sees my content."
How does a company this big not have a single person to contact about my account being hacked!!! The hacker has changed all of my log in information and help center is no help at all! I have had my account for over 15 years and my family and life is in that account! I need my account back!,2,"As a user of a large company with over 15 years of experience, I am frustrated with the lack of support I received when my account was hacked.

Have you encountered this issue before?"
"Ive gotten banned twice a month and I havent even used this app much to share my opinion like I used to. I got banned for sharing a motivational quote with a male chest showing working out followed by a ban for trying to sell a post pregnancy girdle. Its pathetic. Theres nothing you can do about it since you pay them with you private DATA, but have to accept their abuse without being able to appeal.",2,"
As a user who has been banned twice a month from sharing content on the platform/website, I am extremely frustrated with the lack of appeal process and the amount of personal data that is collected by the company. Despite not using the app much for sharing opinions, I have been banned multiple times for sharing motivational quotes and trying to sell pregnancy girdles. It is unacceptable that I am not able to appeal these bans and have my private data be used against me."
"This app and company engages in censorship and supports the Israeli governments war crimes and genocide. I am thoroughly disgusted by Facebook. This company has a total lack of morality. No surprise tho given that they sell our info, and their company founder cheated his cofounder out of millions ",1,"As a user of the app, I am deeply disturbed to discover that it promotes censorship and supports Israeli government war crimes and genocide. It is unacceptable for a platform like this to cater to such actions, and I expect Facebook's business practices to change as well. The company has demonstrated little regard for morality throughout their history, so I do not have any hope that they will behave differently in the future.

User Story: As a user, I want Facebook to adopt ethical and humane practices, especially when it comes to promoting censorship and supporting Israeli government war crimes and genocide."
I do remember better days for Facebook. A time when it acted as versatile tool that could both monitor the kids and look for a used garden tools. Now its political  advertising and old people looking to mingle. The groups of Facebook are gone. For some reason the green thumb group just vanished one day. The gymnastics parents group just vanished one day. Facebook is a washed up old data base much like digging through and old box of paperwork at your xwives house. Goodbye.,2,"As a former user of Facebook, I am disappointed with the changes to the platform. It used to be a versatile tool that allowed me to monitor my kids' activities and find useful information about garden tools. However, it has become primarily focused on political advertising and old people looking to mingle. The groups I created have also disappeared, such as the ""Green Thumb"" group and the ""Gymnastics Parents"" group. It seems that Facebook has lost its luster and is more like a washed up old data base. I miss the functionality of the platform and hope it can be revived."
"Facebook be constantly spying on my google searches, censoring my post, censoring the post I see. They update the app constantly and then my preferences change and I get 30 notifications that arent relevant.",1,"As a user of Meta Platforms' products (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), I want to be able to use these platforms without being constantly spied on or having my posts censored by the company.

"My account just hacked by a unknown user and I tried to proof Im the real user by my passport but you guys said that doesnt help... if a passport cant proof my identity, then what can I do? You want my DNA or something? By the way, theres no customer help number that I could call. Now Facebook became a free information reference for any hackers right now? What a shame....",1,"
As a user, I am frustrated and concerned about the security of my account on your platform. Recently, my account was hacked by an unknown user, and I have tried to prove my identity through my passport, but it seems that it does not help in this case. I understand that DNA testing or other forms of identification may be necessary, but as a user, I feel that it is unreasonable for you to require such measures without providing any alternative solutions.

I am also disappointed that I cannot reach out to your customer support team for assistance with this issue. It seems like the customer service number provided is not functioning properly or may be unavailable due to high volumes of calls. The lack of a clear and efficient way to resolve this issue has caused me significant inconvenience and distress, and I hope that you can provide a more effective solution moving forward."
"They will go out of their way to silence anything  to benefit their personal political views, no freedom of speech here better platforms would be Tik tok . . I have had pictures and videos removed for no reason only because I stand in solidarity for human rights in Palestine and the owners of Facebook are 100 is really Zionist that oppose the movement and they will silence anyone who doesnt fit the narrative",2,"As a user, I want to be able to share my opinions freely on social media without fear of them being taken down for political reasons.

I want to be able to post content that supports human rights in Palestine without facing any kind of backlash or retribution from the platform owners.

I want a social media platform where freedom of speech is valued and not silenced based on personal opinions."
"I can not log in to my account on the app because it claims I have no internet service, which is crap! I can do everything else on my phone! I also can not even access Facebooks page on Safari or Chrome! The pages literally will not open. I did everything suggested, still nothing!",2,"
As a user of the app, I want to be able to log in to my account without any issues so that I can use the app's features and functionality. I want to be able to access Facebook's page on Safari or Chrome without any problems. If the app is unable to do this, it should provide me with a clear explanation of the issue and suggest solutions for fixing it."
"They take no accountability for the real life consequences of their inactions to moderate the content that is posted to the site. App endlessly plays mindless videos to mesmerize you into wasting time on the app. Its worse than watching TV.

FB threw a fit when Apple made changes to iOS that benefit their users privacy. I used to be skeptical of the people who said that Facebook is greedy and super unethical, but its fairly evident now that it may be true.",2,"
As a user, I want to be able to use the app without having to deal with mindless videos playing endlessly in order to waste my time. The app should not take responsibility for real life consequences of users actions."
"Why is the editing button gone? It's our personal post, taking away to add or delete what we've said should be against your policy. You are making, what was thought a freedom of speech and the want to share with the public andor friends very hard to accept. Give us back the choice to edit our posts!!",2,"As a user, I am frustrated because the editing button on my personal post is no longer available. This was my personal space, and taking away the ability to edit my posts has made it difficult for me to share my thoughts and opinions with others. By removing the editing feature, you are not only violating my freedom of speech but also making it hard for me to express myself. I want to be able to fix any mistakes or inaccuracies in my posts and have the option to add or delete content that I feel is necessary. It would make things easier if the editing button was back."
I cant post a status or click on anyones profile without it saying error fetching data not only that fb will ban you if you breath the wrong way no freedom of speech what so ever if I could Id give them 5 star rating,2,"
As a user, I want to be able to post my own status updates and click on other users' profiles without any issues or restrictions. This includes the ability to freely express myself and connect with others through Facebook."
My instagram has been hacked rather easily. the same account is linked to my facebook but for some reason i cannot unlink the instagram  which i no longer have access to from my facebook account which i do have access to. There are scams all over Facebook  instagram running wild even though with just a bit of tech support all these issues could be solved. How you a billionaire and cant fix minor issues like this?,2,"
As a concerned Instagram user, I would like the ability to unlink my Instagram account from my Facebook account, despite it being linked inadvertently. This would allow me to regain control over my personal information and prevent potential security risks associated with having two accounts linked together. Additionally, I would appreciate any steps that can be taken to address the issue of scams on both platforms, as they are harming users' trust and potentially leading to financial loss."
"Ive gotten two consecutive 30 day bans over nothing and there is no recourse, no one to go to.  Ive had several friends get their business pages stolen and Facebook does nothing.  But they let scammers sell fraudulent products like million dollar watches for 100 which they never deliver just steal the money.  But god forbid you post anything about politics or COVID19 and theyll be all over you.  Facebook is run by crooks.",2,"As a concerned Facebook user, I want to have the ability to report any instances of fraudulent activity on the platform, such as scams selling watches for $100 but never delivering them or allowing scammers to sell fake products with no intention of delivering. I also want to be able to report any instances of political bias on the platform and have it taken down quickly so that I can focus on sharing positive content without fear of backlash.

I am also frustrated by the fact that when I try to report a business page that has been stolen from one of my friends, Facebook does nothing to help me reclaim my friend's business page. It is like they are not taking my complaints seriously and that there is no recourse for users who are affected by these types of issues.

Overall, I believe that Facebook needs to take a closer look at the way it handles these types of issues and ensure that users are able to report any instances of fraud or political bias quickly and effectively."
Im not downloading the app. and facebook decided to punish us by refusing to serve users with the same basic features that are apart of the app and desktop sites by removing them when using a mobile phone browser. 0 stars. Do not recommend. Horrible development,2,"
As a user, I am frustrated that Facebook has removed core functionality from their mobile site on my phone, preventing me from enjoying the same features as the app and desktop sites. I would like to see a solution that allows me to use these features while still using a mobile browser."
"I hate this app. All of the casual advertisements popping up after having a private conversation in person about it is a violation of my privacy. This app also silences conservatives, but has allowed sensually explicit spam videos on private community based pages, even after reporting with video and photo evidence. Pure trash.",1,"As a user, I want to be able to have a conversation about the app without constant advertisements being shown in the middle of it. This includes having the ability to block specific types of ads or having a more granular control over when advertisements are displayed.

As a user, I am concerned about my privacy and do not want to be constantly interrupted with unwanted advertisements while having a private conversation. The app should respect my boundaries and give me control over the advertisements that are shown.

As a user, I find it frustrating when conservatives are silenced on the platform and this has led to the acceptance of sensually explicit spam videos on private community based pages even after reporting with video and photo evidence. This behavior goes against the principles of the platform and should be addressed."
"Facebook has a Broken 2 Factor Authentication System. My facebook has two different linked accounts. Unfortunately it doesnt have my mobile number linked so it made it even worse to recover my account. I recently got my i phone 8 replaced because the screen of my older phone broke completely which meant my phone still worked but the screen didnt which gave me no acess to the phone so i had to replace it to another i phone 8. Everything transfered smoothly from one phone to another. Except when i tried to log in it logged me in but facebook didnt recognize the browser of my brand new replacement phone and told me to use the authentication app which i didnt have access to. I have no other known browsers, u tried resetting my password just to be told i need a code from the facebook code generator but youd need access to your facebook account wich i dont have, facebook cant send me an SMS code because my mobile number isnt linked to it, i filled a report and since facebook doesnt have representatives or costumer service i have to wait an eternity. Im disappointed! I cant even log in with my email and i have two if them linked.",2,"As a user, I want the ability to access my Facebook account on my new iPhone 8 without having to use the authentication app, as I cannot access it due to the broken two-factor authentication system.
I want to be able to log in with my email and have both accounts linked so that I can recover my account using one of them.
I want a solution to this problem quickly, as I am disappointed that Facebook cannot send me an SMS code despite my mobile number being linked to the account."
"My account was stolen from me yesterday, where they changed my phone number email and passwords. I never gave them permission to change anything. 

So if you cant get in, there is no way to access the help center. There is no phone number for customer support. 

All because a friends account was hacked? I had very few friends on this platform. Never befriended anyone I did not know. This program is unsafe and terrible. 

Even the police struggle to access them for support. No wonder people die. Shame on Facebook. This day and age, problems like this are unheard of. Worst programs ever.",2,"
As a user who had their account stolen from them, I am unable to access the help center or any customer support. The lack of a phone number for customer support is frustrating and makes it difficult for me to get the assistance I need. Additionally, the fact that my personal information was changed without my permission is a clear violation of trust and security.

I never befriended anyone on this platform that I did not know, so the idea that someone could hack into their account and change my personal information seems incredibly unlikely. Despite this, I have had to deal with the fallout of this situation, which has been unheard of in the modern age. The fact that I cannot get any support from the platform is unacceptable and makes me question the safety and security of using this program.

Overall, the user story is about a user who had their account stolen from them and was unable to access the help center or customer support due to a lack of phone number. The user also expresses frustration with the situation and questions the safety and security of using the platform."
Fakebook is a social platform set up by the see I A designed to track and monitor every thing you have ever posted and store all your information .

As a user of the Facebook platform, I am concerned about the company's actions and the impact it has on my privacy and freedom of speech. The fact that Facebook tracks and monitors everything I post and stores all my information without my consent makes me uneasy. Furthermore, I believe that Facebook promotes violence and lies, suppressing the truth. These actions by Facebook are harmful to society as a whole and undermine our right to free speech."
"My account was hacked by someone who was on my friends list. A gift card was purchased using my account. Messages of fraudulent nature were sent to several friends. On top of this, several accounts in my name were created. And I could not edit or change my data. My name has been used to message me! Facebook. You are on your way out if you cant respond and act on reports that jeopardize my privacy!",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated by the recent hacking incident where someone used my account to purchase a gift card, send fraudulent messages to my friends, and create multiple accounts in my name. This not only compromised my personal information but also made it difficult for me to edit or change my data. The worst part is that the hacker has been able to use my name to message me, further violating my privacy. I am disappointed with Facebook's lack of response and action on this issue, as I feel that my privacy has been compromised and that my account has been used for nefarious purposes."
"Facebook Policy only works for them in order to get more stronger, I think they should be neutral when it comes to human privacy and share the correct news data not misleading people on what they think right and not.",2,"

"My account was hacked and the help support page sent me in loop. Im unable to recover my account and one of my backup emails got spammed by the hacker. 

There is no live supportchat for this issue. Fortunately I had disconnected most of my apps that used Facebook. Unfortunately the hackers have my account some private information and access to my friends that started to receive spam as well.",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated with the lack of live support chat for my issue related to my hacked account. The help support page led me in an infinite loop without resolving the issue. Additionally, the hacker has accessed my private information and is spamming my friends' accounts. This issue has caused me significant inconvenience and damage to my online reputation."
"Somehow this apps advertising just happens to know exactly what Im talking about at all times, this includes live conversations.

All the updates that you say to make the app better its a lie you take more control put more ads in and take more of my privacy away! It scares me when a friend post something and when I go to read it a popup comes up from what they posted using my name that the southern party should not know and asking me to join,2,"As a user, I am concerned about the use of my personal information by this platform. The frequent display of pop-ups with ads and the collection of data for unspecified purposes make me feel uneasy. It appears that they are taking more control over my experience and privacy without my consent.

I also expect to have the option to disable pop-ups with ads and have the ability to opt out of data collection for unspecified purposes."
"If I could rate 000, I would, FakeBook! FB has become a part of the swamp! You have suppressed our freedom of speech by fact checking every data posted that does not agree with your personal political select! You have censored everyone that does not agree with your political agenda! Joe Biden is not the president elect according to the US constitution which you have failed to acknowledge. Yall dont get to appoint a president elect! The electoral college system does! BTW, President Trump is still the sitting president!",2,"
As a user of FakeBook, I am deeply disappointed in the way the platform has become a tool for suppressing my freedom of speech. Every time I post something that disagrees with your personal political beliefs, you fact-check and censor it without even giving me the chance to respond. You have taken away my ability to express my opinions and thoughts freely, and it is not acceptable.

Moreover, you have claimed that Joe Biden is not the president-elect despite the US Constitution stating otherwise. This goes against everything I hold dear about democracy and representation. The electoral college system is a fundamental part of our political system, and you have failed to acknowledge this basic principle.

President Trump is still the sitting president, and it is your duty as an administrator of FakeBook to ensure that everyone has access to the information they need to make informed decisions. I expect better from a platform with your reputation, and I will not hesitate to voice my disapproval if these issues are not addressed immediately."
"My Facebook account has been hacked and I have tried EVERYTHING in my power to contact support to get it back up and working for ME! Ive emailed multiple people. Tried to call some numbers I found, did the Facebook.comhacked and it just keeps putting me in circles. 
I have very important information on my Facebook for my business account and I cant even get into anything anymore.

I have tried to send in a form of ID and once I did they were able to update my account to the correct email but they stupidly forgot to take the hacked email off and didnt make mine the primary email so the hacker kept getting the password reset emails and kept just changing the passwords because I would even get any emails to do so..

Facebook support is trash! 

If you ever have any issue they will NOT HELP YOU! 
And now that All the Business information I have is out there thanks to Facebook not being secure enough or help at all , I lost everything. And I am STILL trying to get it back.. so if Facebook support sees this.. I really would appreciate it if you would help me for once! 

Thanks!",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated with the slow response and inadequate support from Facebook's customer service regarding my hacked account. The hacker has continued to reset my password despite multiple attempts at contacting support, causing me to lose all of my important business information. Despite this, I have continued to try and work with them, but their lack of action has left me feeling hopeless. If you are reading this, Facebook, please provide a solution to help me regain control over my account and restore the important information that was lost due to your poor support."

As a user who almost deactivated their account decades ago to find that someone has hacked and restarted it using my photos and name to forward their agenda, I am extremely concerned about the security of my personal information on Facebook. I demand that Facebook takes immediate action to address this issue and help me regain control over my account. It is unacceptable for a platform that prides itself on being secure to allow such breaches without taking adequate measures to protect users' privacy. I urge Facebook to provide a solution to rectify this situation and ensure that my personal information remains safe from unauthorized access."
"The title summarises the feel of been subject to an arbitrary system, dystopic while inefficient, including continuous breaks of personal privacy. All by Facebook.

Apple should reconsider allowing this app in their system.",2,"As a user who has been subjected to an arbitrary and inefficient social media platform, I am concerned about my personal privacy being compromised. The continuous breaks of my privacy by Facebook are a major issue that should not be tolerated. It is unfair that this app is allowed to operate in the public realm as a company. Apple should reconsider allowing it in their system."
"If you want your privacy invaded in every possible way, download this app. They asked for my drivers license, and blatantly stated in the app stores description that theyll have access to EVERYTHING in your media devices database. 

Beware!!!!",2,"As a user who values their privacy, I am horrified by the fact that a website or platform asks for personal information such as my driver's license number and states it will have access to everything in my media device database without my consent.

Sick of their lies and hiding information that the users deserve to know. They have been stealing and using our information for years IMO illegally and I have finally had enough and deleted their app. They have zero right to hush one side of any information unless it is truly dangerous to another person like a threat.

"Used Facebook for over 12 years and was using it as a mom to keep up with friends and share memories. Then, someone hacked my account at 2am so I wasnt able to respond to the emails about the changes to my account. They changed the email to the account and the password. Facebook has no help chat or a person you can talk to about your account  you are all on your own. So now some horrible hacker has access to pictures and videos of my kids. 
I know the owner of Meta has children, he should be deeply ashamed of his app, its security measures, and its nonexistent help for its users.",2,"
As a user of Facebook for over 12 years, I am frustrated with the lack of support and security measures in place to protect my account from hackers. In particular, I was notified that someone had hacked my account at 2am, changing my email address and password without my consent. Despite this, there is no help chat or person available to assist me in regaining control of my account. As a result, a hacker now has access to pictures and videos of my children. I am outraged by this breach of trust and the lack of support from Meta, and I hope that the company will take immediate action to rectify the situation and ensure my privacy and security are protected."
"Whats the point of FB now? 

To track everything you do. Read their AUP and Privacy settings. If you even have this app on an iPhone it tracks and records you using your phone camera even when the app isnt open. 

I kept using the app until the censorship kicked in. This is an evil company. They hide truth but they will be exposed, Light always wins.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated by the company's lack of transparency and privacy concerns. The app tracks my usage even when it is not open, using my phone camera without my consent.

I believe that the company is hiding the truth and will be exposed for their actions. I hope that users are aware of these concerns and take action to protect their privacy."

My account was hacked and I have and my fiends have tried to contact Facebook to fix and resolved the issue. The sad part is they are using my name and h information saying that I am selling dogs and they are taking innocent peoples money. This is just heart breaking and sad. No one has contacted me as I keep sending emails to the security team. I have had this account for so long I didnt ever think I could or would go through something like this. Just a shame,2,"
As a user, I want Facebook to take immediate action to stop my account from being used to sell dogs and scam innocent people. I am the victim of an identity theft and I am concerned about my personal information being used for malicious purposes. I have tried contacting the security team multiple times but no one has responded. It is very frustrating that the perpetrators are using my name and information to make a false claim, and it has caused me a great deal of emotional distress. I hope that Facebook will take this issue seriously and take appropriate action to protect its users from such scams in the future."
Your censorship on people and posts that are giving information about vaccines andor is rather disappointing. People can choose for themselves to read or move along. You should not be censoring peoples personal stories on the information being shared.,2,"
As a user, I am disappointed by the censorship of people's posts and personal stories related to vaccines on the platform. It is important for users to have the freedom to share their own experiences and opinions about vaccines without fear of censorship or interference from the platform. The platform should allow users to freely express themselves and not infringe upon their rights to do so."

"Facebook is nothing but a communists tool used to control information. Banning people, making things like female roommate preferred illegal to use, choosing what and what not to ban or promote. Zuckerberg is an evil person. Facebook tracks your every move! You have no privacy, and they sell the data they collect on you to control you some more.",2,"As a user of Facebook, I am very concerned about my privacy and the way the platform is being used. I believe that Facebook's actions are an attack on free speech and individual autonomy, as well as a threat to my personal information and data privacy. I would like to see more transparency from Meta in how they collect, use, and protect user data, and I believe that this should be a priority for the platform.

In particular, I am frustrated by the way Facebook has been using its power to censor certain voices and ideas, and the way it has been prioritizing profits over privacy and individual freedom. As a user, I have come to rely on Facebook as a means of connecting with others and sharing information, but now I am concerned about the platform's role in shaping public opinion and silencing dissenting voices.

I would like to see Meta take a more proactive approach to addressing these concerns, by being more transparent about their data collection practices and providing users with more control over their personal data. Additionally, I believe that Meta should be held accountable for the ways in which they are using their platform to manipulate and control information, and that there should be greater oversight of their actions by regulatory bodies and third-party watchdogs."

I will dance the day your offices close",2,"As a user, I want to be able to freely express my thoughts and opinions without fear of censorship or retribution. I believe that private companies should not be exempt from the Constitution's protections for free speech and assembly, and therefore I demand that you take action to ensure that my personal information is not used to monitor or control me.

In addition, I would like to request that you provide users with clear and concise information about your platform's data collection practices, as well as the specific types of data that are being collected and why. This transparency is essential for users to make informed decisions about their privacy and to feel confident in the security of their personal information."
Why does Facebook requestrequire a government ID?  And in the fine print suggest they share info for up to 30 days with trusted partners.  I deleted my data and this app 5 years ago and returned only for the marketplace.  So much for that!,2,"As a user, I am frustrated when Facebook requests my government ID to verify my identity. This process is unnecessary and infringes on my privacy. By sharing my personal information with trusted partners for up to 30 days, Facebook compromises my security and the security of my personal data. I deleted my data from this app 5 years ago and returned only for the marketplace, so much for that!

Functionalities:

* Facebook requests government ID to verify identity
* Sharing personal information with trusted partners for up to 30 days compromises privacy and security

"The platform now is not allowing me to update my profile picture from the ones I already have.   

Know what you are getting into, no personal info to be input, FB will sell it. Robotic censorship for the little guy, yet allows gross misinformation for the ones who pay.",2,"
As a user of the platform, I am unable to update my profile picture as I have already uploaded them. The platform does not allow me to change my pictures even though I want to. This is concerning since the information I provide on the platform can be sold and used without my consent. Furthermore, the fact that some misinformation is allowed to spread while others are censored is unjust."
"Whatever theyve done has totally messed up ability to easily update Pages other than my Personal page.  This means I cant help with my volunteer jobs, as before.  Very sad to see something Launched without first TESTING it.  One day, things work easily next day were told account is disabled.",2,"As a Facebook user who relies on the platform for various aspects of life, I am disappointed by the recent changes to the Pages feature. My ability to easily update and manage my Personal page has been significantly impacted by the new updates. This makes it challenging for me to help with my volunteer activities, which were previously possible. I understand that updates are necessary for a platform to evolve and improve, but this situation has left me feeling frustrated and disconnected from the platform.

To resolve this issue, I would like Facebook to provide a clear explanation of what changes were made and how they may affect existing features or functionalities. Additionally, I would appreciate it if Facebook could restore my ability to easily update and manage my Personal page. This would help me continue to use the platform as intended and ensure that I can continue to participate in activities that are important to me."

I do not have confidence in their ability to protect my data and would like to see a commitment to transparency and responsible behavior."
"I was hacked, FB app ask me to change my password, which I did. Then it said I wasnt old enough to have a Facebook, Ive had my acct longer than the minimum age.

Cant contact them in anyway, horrible customer service!",2,"As a user who was hacked and experienced issues with Facebook's support team, I am frustrated with the following experience:

1. My account was compromised through a security breach.
2. Facebook asked me to change my password after being notified of the incident.
3. Despite updating my password, I was denied access to my account due to the minimum age requirement for creating a Facebook account.
4. After requesting proof of my age and providing it, I still had no access to my account.
5. The customer service team did not respond to my inquiries or provide any assistance.
6. I am still unable to access my account after over four months have passed since the incident."
My account was hacked and there is literally ZERO way of contacting Facebook about all of my information being taken etc. its been several days now and nothing. I even tried to make a new account and I cant even do that. I get an error message every single time.,2,"
As a user, I am unable to recover my hacked Facebook account due to the lack of communication from Facebook regarding my compromised information."
"Facebook is becoming granny app type of thing, if I can give zero, I would. Their privacy setting is horrible and they try to keep it alive by trying to connect it to other apps. Facebook as a company will be on the decline, sooner that Later no morals or principals. Hope Apple will be ready to fill the void.",1,"
User Story:
As a user of Facebook, I want the platform to have robust privacy settings and policies in place to protect my personal information from being misused. Additionally, I desire for Facebook to prioritize its users' safety and security, as well as the overall well-being of our society, by avoiding any actions that could be harmful or illegal.

Functionality:
The platform should have a robust privacy setting system, which would allow users to control their personal data sharing with third-party apps, friends, and other entities. Additionally, the platform should have clear policies regarding user data protection and privacy, as well as consequences for any violations of these policies.

Overall, the user story highlights the importance of Facebook's commitment to user safety and security while also prioritizing users' privacy and personal information."
"Facebook is terrible. Fact checkers fact check everything, even if its a video and they do say whatever the fact checkers say they are not doing. Censorship is terrible. And the privacy settings are dangerous.",2,"
As a user of the social media platform Facebook, I am extremely frustrated with the amount of censorship and privacy concerns that come with using the platform. Even if I fact-check everything myself, it seems like the fact checkers on the site often have different opinions than me. This leads to a lot of time spent arguing with them over small issues. Additionally, I am extremely concerned about the amount of censorship that happens on the site. It seems like anything I post that is even remotely controversial is deleted or hidden from my feed. This takes away my ability to freely express myself and share my thoughts without fear of censorship. Furthermore, I am worried about the privacy settings that Facebook has in place. I want to control who can see my information and how it is used, but it seems like these settings are not as secure as they could be. Overall, I feel that Facebook is a platform that is more harmful than helpful and would prefer to not use it."
All the updates that you say to make the app better its a lie you take more control put more ads in and take more of my privacy away! It scares me when a friend post something and when I go to read it a popup comes up from what they posted using my name that the southern party should not know and asking me to join! Did it weeks ago its review and its still happening liar liar pants on fire and theyre getting away with it,2,"As a user, I am concerned about the privacy of my account information. When I log in, I want to be able to control what information is shared with third-party apps.

I also do not like the popup window that appears when I try to read a post. The information being asked for goes beyond what I gave permission for, and it concerns me that my name is being used without my consent."
"they keep deleting my review because it calls them out on their bigotry. how dare i tell the truth, right? facebook has an option to report hate speech but ALL reported hate speech doesnt go against their community standards. they also do nothing about spam and do NOT protect your privacy.

"Ever wondered how advertisers know what youre thinking about? Well, thats because they actively listen to you. Yep. You read that right. The microphone access you give both of these companies work seamlessly together to piece a profile catered specifically to your preferences. They analyze what you say and then pump that into your feed. Its sick. Targeted advertising shouldnt be a clause in some vague terms amp conditions nobody ever reads. On top of that they censor everything and anything that challenges their constituents over at Washington. Im serious, this platform has been compromised for a while. I dont use Facebook at all except for when I need to call someone. Everything else will just dumb you down, like its already been proven to do so.",2,"As a user, I want the ability to access my microphone without being forced to use it for targeted advertising and censorship from Facebook's partnership with Meta. I want to see the platform I use every day remain uncompromised by the political leanings of major corporations. "

It would be beneficial if Facebook could implement measures to better protect users from scammers and ensure that personal information is kept confidential."
Found spyware Im pretty familiar with hacking .. its Chinese and its in everybodys Facebook .. was curious if I was the only one so I hacked multiple accounts ..

As a user of this platform/website, I am frustrated with the censorship they impose on my access to information and entertainment. The updates that deviously steal personal data to pad their profits are also concerning, as they compromise my privacy and security.

"Interesting how even after doing everything in the Facebook settings to eliminate sponsored posts, I start seeing ads on the app within hours of using a navigation app, opening a YouTube link from Facebook, or even just searching for a place on Google and just putting in a general area instead of allowing it to use my location. The ask app not to track pop up is purely cosmetic and the fact that it does it anyway is clearly a violation of Apples terms.",2,"
As a Facebook user, I am frustrated by the presence of sponsored posts on my feed even after taking steps to eliminate them in the platform's settings. Specifically, I find it annoying when I open a YouTube link from Facebook, search for a place using a general area instead of allowing it to use my location, or use a navigation app and see ads on the app within hours of using it.

I believe that these features are violations of Apple's terms of service and are not only cosmetic, but also harmful to my online experience. I hope that Facebook will take action to address this issue and provide me with a more private and secure platform."
"I recently took a trip to Europe and made about 4 posts and 1 live video. Days later all of the sudden my posts were deleted even on some that people are tagged in. The photos are shown in my photos but my posts were deleted from my profile page. However, you can see the posts in the profile of the people who were tagged except my profile.

"Im always reporting scammers, accounts with nudity pics, fake accounts and false information. You fools never take down the accounts or limit the accounts for going against community standards.

One day you all will be YouTube pop pop with the Glock Glock.

I removed the app and I am not getting back on data abuse book.",2,"As a user, I want to be able to report scammers who post nude photos, fake accounts, and false information in my posts. It is frustrating when these types of accounts are allowed to exist without being taken down or limited by the platform. When I try to report them, I am told that they have violated community standards, but the platform does not take any action against them.

I would like the platform to take a stronger stance against scammers and those who post inappropriate content. It is also important for the platform to provide more effective tools for users to report suspicious activity and for the moderators to take appropriate action against such accounts."
"Facebook is actively suppressing points of view they do not agree with or that dont meet there agenda which is a direct violation of the 1st amendment.  They also make billions selling your personal data, while they actively indoctrinate you.  This app is the cause of a lot of the worlds issues.  Why do people who helped create it not use it and forbid their children from doing the same.",1,"As a user, I want to be able to express my thoughts and opinions without fear of retribution or censorship.
I want to have access to information that is accurate and unbiased.
I want to be able to interact with others who share similar beliefs and values.

"Fakebook is SO CORRUPT, they REFUSE TO DO THE SLIGHTEST THING TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS.

That GRIFTER, ZUCKERBERG, didnt even INVENT Facebook!

Its a U.S. Government PsyOp to gather and collate YOUR PERSONAL AND PRIVATE DATA.

I KNOW ITS YUGE, BUT USE IT AT YOUR PERIL!",2,"
As a Facebook user, I am deeply concerned about the platform's reputation for corruption and data misuse. Despite Zuckerberg's claims of innocence, it is clear that Facebook has a history of ignoring customer concerns and prioritizing profits over privacy. My personal data has been collected and used in ways that have compromised my safety and well-being. I demand that Facebook take immediate action to address these issues and protect the privacy and security of its users."
"This used to be a platform to connect and share but it is clear now that the algorithm is also disruptive with constant unnecessary ads and invasion of privacy.

"Ive been on FB ever since it was released I love the new features theyve added over the years, not a fan of them selling peoples data amp information.... but now some features on the iPhone app dont work anymore...marketplace doesnt work, it just shows a blank screen. Then when you message someone from marketplace, your chats dont show up in messenger....its really annoying. You have to find the market place post then click See conversation. Thats the only way you can see the chats",2,"As a long-time Facebook user, I am disappointed that some features on the iPhone app no longer work as intended. The Marketplace feature no longer works properly, displaying a blank screen instead of showing marketplace posts. Additionally, when trying to communicate with someone through the Marketplace, their messages are not displayed in Messenger. This makes it difficult for me to engage with others and share information in the same way I do on the web version of Facebook."

This has caused significant inconvenience and frustration, as I am now unable to access my own account and continue promoting my music."
"From selling our info, to tricking us, lying to us, and manipulating what we see and say, Facebook has done nothing to protect their customers.  The platform is a joke.

As a user of Facebook, I am deeply disappointed and frustrated with the lack of protection and care provided by the platform. From selling my personal information without my consent, to lying about the purpose of data collection, manipulating my privacy settings, and hiding important information from me, I have experienced numerous instances of misuse and exploitation by Facebook. Despite the company's claims of apologizing for past injustices, it has failed to take action to address these issues and protect its users. The platform is a joke that shows no regard for my trust or privacy."

User Story:
As an individual looking to use social media responsibly, I want to be able to control my own privacy settings and block access to Facebook's algorithms that are prioritizing certain content over others. This would allow me to maintain the privacy and security of my personal information while still being able to connect with friends and family who may also value this type of experience."
"The app is trash. Not only is it violently unstable, riddled with bugs, and dark mode still broken after weeks, it gargles resources for lunch and chugs battery life.

Oh and it gives Facebook yet another way to invasively track you, creeping into your phones permissions and invasively gathering website data even when you dont use the app. Turning off this setting requires around nine clicks, I counted. And you have to reset turning off that setting after a major app update or it just turns itself back on.

And Facebook is one of the worst companies in the world. Humanity is their commodity and they buy and sell your online identity. Delete the app and delete your account.",2,"
As a user, I am extremely frustrated with this app's unstable performance and invasive tracking features. The app's stability is a significant issue, as it frequently crashes and freezes, resulting in lost work and frustration. Additionally, the ""Dark Mode"" feature still does not work after weeks of use, and the app consumes excessive resources for lunch and drain battery life.

Furthermore, I am concerned about Facebook's invasive tracking practices, which allow them to collect and sell my online identity. As a user, I would like to have more control over my data privacy and wish to delete the app and delete my account with Facebook."
I have been a facebook customer for several years and recently had my account hacked. I have reached out so many times to have this corrected without result. I have decided that it is a poor application especially given that they can take your information and do whatever they want with it!,2,"

It is unacceptable that a company can take my information and do whatever they want with it!"
"you are no longer able to restrict profiles eventhough the option is there if you jump through enough hoops, BUT you get an error when you try to add someone to the list.

Just a shame Going back to MYSPACE!!!",1,"
As a user, I want to be able to restrict access to my profiles, so that I can control who can see my information and interact with me on the platform. However, despite having this option available, I am unable to use it due to an error message when trying to add someone to the list. This is frustrating as I am no longer able to fully control my own online presence.

Additionally, I want to be able to remove friends and delete accounts, but am met with errors instead. It's a shame that this feature was taken away from me, as it was an essential part of using the platform."
"My account was hacked and the support line was absolutely no help whatsoever. I was accused of posting something against their standards of child sexual exploitation and unable to get access back to my account. Lost over 10 years of photos and memories. To top it off, I created a new Facebook and after 1 day theyve prohibited me from liking, commenting, or posting.",2,"
As a user who had their account hacked and lost access to their photos, I would like the following features implemented:

"They havent changed much when it comes to privacy, anyone can still share your pics. They dont prevent online bullying. They let people manage local groups that dont even live in the target area. There is no customer support so dont bother trying to reach out to anyone because there is no one to reach out to. I tried to think of something positive I could say about Facebook but nothing comes to mind its just a waste of time. And I also believe that Facebook starts conflicts because they think your value is based on how many likes you get in life just to make you feel inadequate. I cant tell you how many times Ive deleted this stupid app thinking itd be different or better in some way after two years but nope Facebook still does one thing thats consistent, disappoint.",1,"As a user of the platform/website, I am frustrated with the lack of privacy and security features, the inability to prevent online bullying, and the ability for users to create and manage local groups that do not even live in the target area. I have also found that customer support is unavailable or inadequate, which has led me to delete the app multiple times thinking it would be different or better after two years. Additionally, Facebook seems to prioritize likes over actual human connection and value, which I find disappointing and dehumanizing."

",2,"As a user who has been impacted by Facebook's failure to protect my account from being hacked, I am outraged that the platform failed to provide adequate support or resolution to this issue. Instead of addressing the problem and providing proper assistance to those who are affected, they chose to ignore me.

Shutting down the platform would allow it to take responsibility for the actions of its users and address this problem."
"Looks like the app doesnt recognize my current password when Im prompted to login again to access my account info.  And Im hesitant to logout of the app completely and back in again to try to reset this for fear Ill be locked out of the app until this bug is fixed!

I have been hacked for the last 3 months and the person changed the email address, and added a code generator so that I would not be able to get access to it. I have submitted my ID 4 times with no success, and have tried to submit and report the issue, but every time it just tells me that it could not process my request. Facebook should have somewhere we can actually communicate with humans so this wouldnt be an issue. Wish I had access to all my memories.",2,"As a user of Facebook for 14 years with many memories, I am frustrated by the recent hacking and lack of communication from the platform. I have tried to report the issue multiple times but it has been unsuccessful. I would like to request that there be a way for humans to communicate with the platform directly so that I can access my account and recover my memories."
Facebook is abusing its platform to silence and censor voices. Its unbelievable! Mark needs to go back to start and stop using his platform for his political agendas. Also protect peoples privacy instead of abusing it without their permissions.,2,"As a user, I am frustrated by the lack of transparency and accountability on Facebook's part in suppressing dissenting voices and censoring information. This behavior is unacceptable and threatens to undermine trust in the platform. It is crucial that Facebook prioritize the safety and well-being of its users by respecting their privacy settings and not using the platform for political agendas without their consent."
For the second time as a member of Facebook my Facebook account had been hacked!!!! I have received Facebook messages from over 40 friends about the hack but I am unable to see what the hack says.

I now have to completely delete the app when logging out. It will not disconnect. Ever. The circular symbol keeps spinning. It will not let me disconnect.

"Social media platforms, like Facebook, are poison to your mind. They sell your data and are building a digital profile of you, all the things you like, dislike, hope or wish for, and fear is in your digital profile. Not to mention this platform is designed to be addicting so that you keep coming back... Think about the last time that you opened Facebook. Did you make the conscious choice to do it, or are you just doing it by habit? Get off of Facebook and start living your life again.

"The scrolling feature is acting really off the past couple of days. I even deleted the app and redownloaded it. I have the most up to date iOS. It scrolls whacky like you are being remotely hacked. The app isnt acting right. The FB app behaves like right as your phone dies things start acting delayed and reallllly slow or superrrrr sped up. . .

FIX THIS!",2,"As a user of the Facebook app, I am experiencing issues with the scrolling feature. The feature is acting erratically, scrolling slowly or rapidly depending on how fast I swipe my finger. This issue has been present for several days and I have tried to troubleshoot it by reinstalling the app and updating my operating system to no avail. It is only occurring on the Facebook app and not on any other apps on my phone.

I would like the feature to be fixed so that I can continue to use the app smoothly. Please prioritize this issue and provide a solution as soon as possible."
Facebook generates its incomprehensibly massive revenue off of the account holders. The account holders own the personal data within the account. Common decency in business practice would uphold the priority of a strong symbiosis between the two. This is not the operating practice of this company. Unethical business practice is the dismal reality the account holders are left to face. And share holders are likely not far behind.,2,"
As a Facebook user, I am concerned about the ethics of the platform's operations and the impact it has on my personal data. The company generates massive revenue off of account holders, but does not prioritize their concerns as much as their own profits.

I fear that other shareholders may be similarly impacted by this lack of concern for ethical business practices."
"Ive been getting error fetching data errors every 20 seconds. I cant even use the app anymore. Ive tried all trouble shooting options.

Therefore, I would like the website to provide a solution to this issue as soon as possible so that I can continue using the app without any interruptions."
"Facebook used to be cool then it went to trash as everyone realized its gov started and owned,then it helped the horrible outcome of our elections, and overall we all need to hop off it and goto FreeTalk45 for less policing and freedom to say what you want on your stuff. No biometric data needed. You shouldnt have to add personal Information to an app just to use it.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am disappointed in the direction that the platform has taken. I used to enjoy connecting with friends and family on the site, but I have since realized that its governance and ownership have degraded its quality.

Furthermore, I find it disturbing that Facebook can stalk me and listen in on my phone without my consent. Lastly, I am frustrated by the persistent ads for runner rugs from Facebook despite never searching for them myself.

I would like to have a feature that allows me to control my privacy settings and adjust my notifications to be more granular, so that I can choose which information and interactions I want to receive. Additionally, I would like Facebook to prioritize my privacy and security over its own profits and advertising revenue.

"Facebook uses their power to censor posts and hide commentsposts related to topics aka PALESTINE that go against their prozionist, terrorist loving narratives. They willingly hide our posts, prevent us from sharing, and will go so far to delete postsstoriescomments and blame it on a bug. The Zionism shows. The racism shows. The prochildren murder lovers shows. The antisemitism shows. Dont use this app. Youll be happier without it. 

Respect for Apple for shutting down your money hungry privacy stealing scam.",1,"
As a user, I am frustrated with the platform's ability to censor posts and hide comments related to topics such as Palestine. The platform's pro-Israel bias and lack of transparency in its moderation practices have made it difficult for me to share my opinions and experiences without fear of retribution. Despite my attempts to report harmful content, the platform has repeatedly censored my posts and hidden my comments, blaming it on a ""bug"" rather than addressing the issue. The platform's Zionism, racism, and antisemitism are evident in its moderation practices, and I will no longer use the platform due to its harmful and discriminatory nature.

In contrast, Apple has taken action against companies that prioritize privacy over users' rights and have a history of data misuse. The shutdown of these platforms is a welcome move towards maintaining user privacy and security online."
My Facebook has been repeatedly hacked these past few weeks. Im convinced FB has something to do with it. Only way theyre allowing me to unlock my account is to send a full photo of my Government issued ID. Ughh no! Fb doesnt need my physical address and other info thats on my drivers license. What happened to email and text confirmations?? Out the door,2,"
""As a user, I am frustrated that Facebook has repeatedly hacked my account and is now requiring me to send a full photo of my government-issued ID in order to unlock it. This is not only inconvenient but also raises concerns about privacy and security. It would be more secure if Facebook used email and text confirmations instead of relying solely on physical identification."""
"Their updates have made it awkward to use. If you want to respond to a comment, you have to go out of the way to do so. The algorithm is poorly managed, theyll penalize you claiming it goes against their Community Standards when in reality, youve done nothing wrong. You cant get ahold of anyone to report any issues with the platform. It obviously politically motivated and biased, not too mention they wont stop bothering you about their personal agendas such as vaccination information that doesnt provide information at all. I wont recommend this app to anyone.",2,"
As a user of the platform, I am unable to easily interact with others and respond to comments. The algorithm is poorly managed and often results in penalties for seemingly innocent actions. Additionally, there is no way to report issues with the platform or address concerns about its political motivations. As a result, I will not recommend this app to anyone."
FB will do anything they can to get all information on you and sell it. They make it impossibly difficult and confusing to change your privacy settings. Its laid out that way so most people especially the older crowd cant figure out. Much better social media apps out there. Use something else! FB is dead!!,2,"
As a user, I want to be able to control my own privacy settings on the platform, including being able to change them easily and without difficulty. This includes the ability to see who can contact me, who can see my posts, and how my data is used. If I am not comfortable with this, I should have the option to opt out of targeted advertising and other data sharing practices."
"My phone contact list was stolen without my approval !!! 
My friend whos on my contact list bought a product and i was advertised the same product on the next day! Hows that possible if i never searched for such a product and my friend doesnt have a Facebook account! And I didnt even open my Facebook account or messenger for months!! Facebook is the only social app i have on my phone. 
and this happened many times. even my phone   number was shared without permission with advertisers who called me. 
I fear this app is a spying tool on peoples privacy. 
Do Not Install this App.",2,"As a user, I am concerned about the privacy of my contact list and phone number being stolen without my approval. I have never searched for advertisements or used Facebook's services to share my personal information. It is not possible that someone accessed my contact list without my knowledge or permission, especially if they did not even have a Facebook account.

I am also concerned about the use of my phone number by advertisers who call me repeatedly without my consent. This behavior is a violation of my privacy and trust in the app. I do not want to be a pawn in someone else's marketing strategy.

Therefore, I refuse to install this app and will not use Facebook or any other social media platform that compromises my privacy."
It has become increasingly obvious that it is virtually impossible to use the FB app and not have them tracking everything you do even when the app isnt open and youre signed out. There is little doubt in my mind the CIA is directly involved with Zuckerberg and Facebook and it was developed specifically as a tool to track people and collect data.,2,"
User Story: As a concerned user, I want to be able to control my personal information on Facebook and have complete privacy and security when using the platform."
"I dont like that Facebook collects our data and personalizes ads because it makes me look at more things to buy. Can we turn that feature off? I feel like its invasive. Also, there should be a way that we can pin important messages in groupchats on fb messenger.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I want the ability to control my personal data and privacy settings, such as turning off the feature that collects and uses my data for advertising purposes. This is invasive and makes me feel uncomfortable while using the platform. Additionally, I would like to have the option to pin important messages in group chats on Facebook Messenger so that I can easily view them without having to scroll through long conversations."
"Lots of crashes being reported, never got an respond back, and crushes still there. Lot of fake accounts sending spam, and none of them was deleted after reports. Always answer its not harmful. Yes, if someone follow their link and loose money and personal information, its not harmful for Facebook but their standards do not care about you. 
Last one I was banned about Kyle and court ruled that he did nothing wrong. But Facebook thinks different way, court no matter to Facebook representatives, they strike you for 7 days if you support different option than Facebook",1,"
As a user, I am frustrated by the high number of crashes on this platform/website. Despite my attempts to contact support, I have not received any assistance or resolution to the issue. Additionally, many fake accounts are sending spam, and none of these accounts have been deleted after reporting them. This has caused me significant harm and inconvenience.

Facebook's stance on this matter is unclear. Although Kyle was banned for a different reason, his experience highlights the need for more fair and impartial judgments by the platform/website's representatives. I am concerned about my own safety and security, as well as the impact on my reputation and relationships with others on the platform/website.

I would like to see the platform/website take steps to address these issues and provide better support for users who are experiencing problems. This includes increasing transparency around the measures taken against fake accounts, providing more detailed information about user safety policies, and offering better communication channels for users to report and seek assistance on issues related to the platform/website."
"Facebook used to be about community and sharing. All it is now is a glorified data miner for your data and they are making billions off of you. You give them your soul and they give your soul to others. 

Its become nothing more than mindless tv with advertisements everywhere. All eyes are on you and ears and location and likes and dislikes, etc. 

Facebook needs to be illegal. Its practices are.",2,"As a user of Facebook, I value the platform's original purpose as a community for connecting and sharing information. However, I find the current state of the platform to be unethical and invasive. I am concerned about the amount of data that is collected from me and how it is used. Additionally, I feel that the platform has become more focused on advertising and less on personal connections. It feels like a mindless TV with constant notifications and targeted ads. I believe that Facebook's practices are unjustifiable and should be illegal."
My profile was hacked about a month ago. My email and password were changed so I wasnt able to get back into it. I was notified by email that this happened and followed a link to prove my identity. I submitted my personal information to this link and waited for them to confirm. After 48 hours they confirmed my ID and sent me a new password and a link to follow. It did not work. I emailed Facebook security to tell them it wasnt working and have not received a response in a very long time. I have contacted them now 3 times by email. I still have not received a response. I wish there was a phone number I could call to expedite this process. I am extremely dissatisfied with their service. If I could give a rating of zero I would.,2,"As a user, I want the ability to recover my hacked account quickly and efficiently so that I can regain access to my personal information. This includes having a dedicated phone number for urgent issues and effective communication regarding the status of my request. If Facebook fails to respond to my requests despite repeated attempts, it is unfair to assign a rating of zero."
"Listen, I know we all know about cookies and how the entire Internet is selling our information for profit all the time, but Facebook is the worst for it. Im pretty sure Facebook is even the CAUSE of it. You have ZERO privacy on facebook, its disgusting. Also racist censorship. Ugly app, ugly human who made the app hes probably a lizard. Do yourself a favor and just get off Facebook.",2,"As a user, I am frustrated with the lack of privacy and censorship on Facebook. I believe that Facebook is the cause of the widespread collection of personal information by companies and governments. I would like to have more control over my personal information and would appreciate it if the platform could address these issues."
"Facebook has become the network of choice for the Democratic Socialist Party. They push an agenda of misinformation and only allow for just one side of a conversation. That one side is that of the Democratic Socialist Party. If the view is not in their, Facebook, best interest then they, Facebook, will censor those views. Facebook doesnt allow for a fair and equitable distribution of information so its members can make an informed decision on their own. If I couldve given a lower rating than 1 star I would have! So if you wish to have every post censored and even have ALL OF YOUR PRIVATE MESSAGES READ AND CENSORED. Then by all means download this tracking app and have your life made public! If you like being able to separate your public from private life get MeWe and Parlor apps!",1,"As a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, I am frustrated with Facebook's lack of transparency and censorship. The platform only allows for one side of a conversation, which is that of the Democratic Socialist Party. If my viewpoints are not in the best interest of Facebook, they will censor them.

Instead, I suggest using other platforms that allow for a fair and equitable distribution of information, such as MeWe or Parlor."
Facebook turns people into products. They manipulate algorithms to spoon feed certain ideologies and to suppress others. All while making BILLIONS as they collect and sell every bit of personal information you provide. Youre literally just a human battery in the Matrix when you use Facebook. And free speech on the platform is highly suppressed. Theyre too busy catering to their woke agenda. Dont expect their alleged community standards team to be anything close to reasonable if youre not a full blown anarchy loving communist who hates America. It should be renamed community DOUBLE standards team. Youre better off deleting the app and watching how much better life can be when you dont have a 247 megaphone of actual disinformation doing everything that it can to control your perception of reality. Good luck and God bless. May the awakening continue...,2,"

"The weak security allowed my account to be hacked. The Facebook folks that dont exist locked down my account and probably will elimininate by the account, just that there is no one to talk to they make no investigation and I end up loosing all my pictures, friends and memories saved there. They should have costumer service for more than d charge money to their customers. 

Not sure it is worth it to even download it",2,"
As a user of the platform, I am frustrated with the lack of security on my account. A hacker was able to gain access to my account and delete all of my pictures, friends, and memories. The Facebook support team did not investigate the issue and ended up locking down my account without any communication. This experience has made me question whether it is worth using the platform anymore. I hope that the company will take measures to improve security and provide better customer service in the future."
"I wouldnt want my information been sold and also Facebook doesnt check for fact checkers wether they are capable of judging without a biases. Its like 1 person researching all this information about everything which is too much for one person to handle.
I also think that suppression of information is and has been enforced which in itself is a violation of freedom speech.",1,"
As a user, I want Facebook to prioritize user privacy by not selling my personal information without my consent. Additionally, I would like Facebook to have more robust fact-checking measures in place to prevent the spread of misinformation and biased content. The sheer volume of information available on the platform can be overwhelming for individuals, and it is important that Facebook takes steps to ensure that users are not subjected to too much bias or misinformation."

Up until yesterday I was always able to edit posts I made on personal pages from my phone on the FB app.  Today cannot. I can only edit posts if I use the desktop version on my cell phone browser or from the computer. Using the FB app I cannot edit anything. In fact when you click those 3 buttons in top right even what you see if different. What the heck Facebook?  I even reported issue.,2,"
As a user, I want to be able to edit posts I make on my personal page from my phone using the FB app, just as I have been able to do until yesterday. However, I am now unable to do so. Instead, I can only edit posts if I use the desktop version on my cell phone browser or from the computer. When trying to edit a post through the FB app, the buttons in the top right of the screen appear differently and I am unable to edit anything.

"I was hacked back in April, and lost 10 years of memories and pictures and everything and tried so hard to get back into my account and its impossible to communicate with anybody from Facebook. It pretty much runs itself. Mark is a genius. But now Im trying to reset up accounts and I cant remember the password and when it says try another way its still asks for your password. Now I just want to set up a whole new account but Im debating as to whether or not I should even bother. What a pain in the butt and I could see that from the reviews theres a lot of other people that dont like Facebook either.",2,"As a user, I am frustrated with the difficulty I have had resetting my account on Facebook due to a recent hack that has resulted in me losing 10 years of memories and pictures. Despite trying to communicate with Facebook support, it has been impossible to get back into my account. The process is lengthy and asks for my password multiple times, which I can't remember. Now, I am considering setting up a whole new account but am unsure if that will solve the issue. Many other users have reported similar issues with Facebook, making me question whether or not to continue using the platform."
For some time Facebook fact check had been branding various posts as misleading info such as screen shots from CDC website or WHO directly. When pushed to remove or explain why the complaint gets no response and to date fake check still blurts post,2,"
As a user who has noticed false information being spread on Facebook fact-check's platform, I would like to see them respond to my complaints and provide an explanation for their actions. It is unacceptable for fact-checking organizations to mislead users by spreading false information, especially when it comes from a reputable source such as the CDC or WHO. I believe that Facebook should take responsibility for ensuring that its platform does not host false information and provide an explanation for why they are still allowing this to continue."
On a pretty large but still limited data plan and havent hit the cap almost ever. Get a warning that Im close so I check whats going on. I see within the last 25 days FB has used 6G of data. Im thinking the reels feature they just added is preloading videos.,2,"As an avid user of Facebook, I am frustrated by the frequent warning messages that pop up on my phone reminding me that I'm close to reaching my monthly data cap. I have a limited data plan and haven't reached the cap yet, but even so, I receive these notifications frequently.
Recently, I noticed that my usage has been increasing significantly in the last 25 days, and I suspect that this increase is due to the new Reels feature.
I would like to request a solution from Facebook to reduce my data usage for the new Reels feature.
This would be helpful as it would allow me to continue using the platform without the constant warnings and also prevent any further disruption to my phone's internet connectivity."
All day it has been saying no internet connection and not posting on my story and not loading my timeline like Facebook has just completely crashed.

User Story: As a user of the platform, I want to be able to log in to my existing Facebook account without any issues, so that I can access all my personal information securely and avoid any potential security threats.

I know it was my fault but I wasnt thinking ! Its so easy for someone to scam you and then try and scam your family and friends ! Facebook doesnt care either unless you buy an oculus ! I cant get back into my Facebook and my friends are saying this person that took over my Facebook is begging for money. Facebook is horrible ! They collect your data and dont care about you .,2,"
User Story:
As a user who experienced scamming on Facebook, I want to ensure that the platform takes necessary measures to prevent such incidents from happening again, especially when it comes to protecting users' personal information.

"Facebook deleted an account that was hacked that I owned for 15 years. Multiple attempts to deactivate have left with nothing because there is NOTHING you can do. And since you are not paying for the app they dont care. Everyone who has ever used this app knows that they make money off of you one way or another. But for me, 15 years of memories, 2 biz pages and an IG account hacked and gone no content I ever posted is in any group or community. Its theft of ideas, memories relationships because they choose not to help. Then they blame the lack of customer service in covid. It is sad how intertwined we have become with this format and yet they have no responsibility in what they have created.",1,"As a former user of the app, I am extremely disappointed that my account was hacked and deleted without any option to reactivate or recover my content. Multiple attempts to deactivate my account have been unsuccessful, leaving me with nothing but a blank slate. The lack of customer service and support for this issue is unacceptable in today's world where technology has made it easier than ever for people to share their ideas and memories online.

I have invested 15 years into building my profile on the platform, creating two business pages, and an Instagram account. I have shared valuable content and relationships with others through this app. The fact that the company is unwilling to help me recover my account or provide any support in this matter is unacceptable and shows a lack of responsibility for what they have created.

The fact that the app makes money off of users in one way or another is not an excuse for their neglect of customer service. I demand that the company provides a solution to allow me to recover my account and retrieve my content."
"This app or better, this company more and more wants to spy on us, last to have access to our documents. Pat in the end to sell them, more and more they want to control their clients according to how they want to protect our information, everything is a lie.",2,"
As a concerned user of this app or company, I want to ensure that my personal information is kept private and secure, so that I can feel comfortable using the platform without fear of being monitored or had access to my documents by the company or third parties. I also want to have control over how my information is used and shared, and to be able to opt-out of any data collection or usage practices that I do not agree with."
Facebook is silencing people and deleting their post. Their loyalty was never to their customers. The privacy is something to be concerned with. As well as if you would like to write and spread awareness about a humanitarian issue think agian before using Facebook. Because theyll delete your posts if the government told them to.,2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am concerned about the platform's recent actions of silencing users and deleting their posts. This has caused harm to my ability to freely express myself and share information with others. Additionally, the lack of transparency around this decision-making process is concerning, as it makes it difficult for me to trust the platform with my personal information. As a user, I would like to have more control over what content I see on Facebook, and I hope that the platform will address these issues in order to maintain trust and confidence in their platform."
Facebook blocked me from marketing my legal businesses. They have censored free speech. They violate your privacy and sell your data . Some even say it's a CIA operative. Huge data collection facilities in Utah,2,"As a small business owner, I am frustrated with Facebook's lack of transparency regarding their marketing policies and practices. The fact that they have censored my ability to promote my legal businesses is unacceptable and violates my right to free speech. Additionally, the fact that they collect and sell user data without informing users or obtaining their consent is also a cause for concern. It's clear that Facebook has a problem with privacy and transparency, and as a user I expect more from them."
In the last 6 months Facebook business page has become a big hassle. I cant toggle back and forth from my personal page easily.  Every function has become difficult to use. Please make it user friendly again.,2,"As a Facebook user, I want to be able to easily switch between my personal and business pages without any issues or frustration. This includes being able to use the platform's features with ease and accuracy."
"This app is useless and I havent used it in ages, Im scared of posting anything due to censorship, getting my information stolen, and getting banned for being myself. Ive honestly given up on social media because of all the censorship now a days",1,"As a user who has been struggling with the constant censorship on social media platforms, I am frustrated with the lack of freedom to share my thoughts and opinions without fear of retribution or loss of access. I have not used the app in a long time due to the constant threat of my information being stolen or my account being banned for expressing myself honestly.

I believe that social media platforms should allow users to freely express themselves without fear of reprisal or consequences. This includes the ability to post and share content without fear of censorship, harassment, or retribution.

As a user who has been impacted by the current state of social media, I am calling for action to be taken to address these concerns and ensure that users have the freedom to express themselves freely online."
I really wish family was not on this app so I could get rid of it. The fact that my oculus needs a profile to be used is  stupid. The day Valve releases a standalone VR headset Im jumping ship. Start giving a  about your community and our privacy. Try not to be so evil. We are people.,1,"As a user, I would like to have the ability to remove my profile from this app so that I can get rid of it altogether. The fact that my Oculus needs a separate profile to use is frustrating and makes me want to get rid of the app. When Valve releases a standalone VR headset, I plan on jumping ship as I no longer wish to be associated with this platform. Additionally, I would like more information about the company's community and privacy policies to better understand their stance on these matters."
This app is awful but thats besides the point. Your information is being sold to the highest bidder and then used against you. Will never use Facebook again. What they are doing amp getting away with is criminal. Delete your accounts unless you want your private info sold to 3rd partys. Bye yuckaburgh ,1,"
As a user, I am horrified to find that my personal information is being sold and used against me without my consent. This app is a disaster, but it's not the only issue. Facebook has a history of selling user data to third parties for profit, which is unacceptable and a violation of trust. I will never use Facebook again, and I urge others to do the same. It's time for this platform to take responsibility for its actions and protect users from such illegal practices."
Facebook openly and illegally censors posts about human rights violations by the terrorist state which calls itself Israel while simultaneously stealing personal data and information from its users to sell that information at a profit.,2,"As a concerned user, I want Facebook to stop censoring my posts about human rights violations in Israel and allow me to share my voice with others. Additionally, I would like them to protect my privacy and not steal my personal data without my consent."
Freedom is not just an idea. This app was supposed to be our town square. It has become something evil and ugly where the truth is hidden and lies are promoted. Its used to track and advertise and truck people into making decisions based on false information. The world is better without it.,2,"As a user, I want the app to be a trusted source of information that promotes accuracy and transparency. I do not want the app to use deceptive practices such as tracking or advertising to manipulate people's decisions. I want the app to be a platform where users can have unrestricted access to accurate and reliable information, without fear of being influenced by false or misleading information."
Read all the privacy and agreements hidden ones too and they steal all your info and sell it. The make it extremely difficult for someone to research what they do with your info. They steal info including stores you visit from your location so they can target ads and so much more let alone the political silencing on both sides. Dont recommend getting this toxic app.,2,"
As a user, I am frustrated by the difficulty of researching what a company does with my personal information. The app I downloaded is extremely invasive and sells my data without my consent. It tracks my location and activities, including stores I visit, even though I have not opted in for that. This makes it impossible for me to research what they do with my info and ensure that I am not contributing to their harmful practices. I would recommend avoiding this app at all costs."
Havent logged on in at least a month. One day the app decided it needed to verify my identity. But when I type in my password it asks me to generate my own code somehow. From what the internet says I need access to the account to use its code generator why it doesnt send a code to my phone to verify is something I dont understand. Greatest thing about Facebook is the complete lack of support. Sell our data all day and night cant even get support for more complex issues it just really shows how much the company DOES NOT CARE.,1,"
As a user who hasn't logged on to my Facebook account in at least a month, I am frustrated when the app suddenly decides to verify my identity. Instead of sending me a code to my phone like it should, it asks me to generate my own code somehow. This process is confusing and time-consuming for someone who has not used the platform in a while.

I understand that Facebook needs to protect users from potential scams and security threats, but I believe they could provide more user-friendly solutions. The fact that I cannot get support for my issue with the lack of support from the company is also concerning. It shows that they do not care about their customers and are more focused on making money."
I would be having a conversation about something and minutes later theres an add about it on my news feed. How can this be legal for them to creep on your conversations??? Its so intrusive. Also why am I not allowed to remove my last name on there? What if Im Concerned about my privacy? You have little to no control what you can do on fb. Why does the cover photo have to be made public so your stalkers can see whos liking your photo? I will be deleting this ASAP and sticking with FaceTime if I want to stay in touch with family. And as much as money fb is making off their ads Im surprised that its dang near impossible to get a hold of an actual live person to resolve an issue. In fact its impossible. What a joke.,2,"As a user, I am frustrated by the intrusiveness and lack of control over my privacy on Facebook. Specifically, I object to the algorithm that shows my posts on someone else's news feed without my consent. This is not only an invasion of my privacy but also a violation of my right to autonomy and self-expression.

Moreover, I am concerned about the lack of transparency in Facebook's data collection practices and the use of my personal information for targeted advertising. It is unacceptable that I cannot remove my last name from Facebook without facing consequences.

Furthermore, I find it unsettling that the cover photo of a group or event becomes publicly visible on Facebook, allowing anyone to see who likes it and potentially stalk me. This is a breach of my privacy and trust in the platform.

In addition, I have found it challenging to resolve issues with Facebook's customer service, as I am unable to speak with a live person for assistance. This frustrating experience has led me to reconsider my usage of the platform and seek alternative means of communication."
Very frustrating. Facebook used to be a place to stay connected with old friendsdistant family etc. now its just adds and poorly managed accounts. Theres no real way to filter out hateful content or other that you dislike. Messenger is a separate app. Everything requires your personal information so it can track you and try to sell you more garbage. Horrible experience.,2,"
As a user, I want Facebook to be a platform where I can connect with people from my past, distant family, and stay connected with them without any hateful content or unwanted advertisements. I also want the ability to filter out content that I do not like, so that my experience on the platform is positive and enjoyable.

As a user, I am frustrated by the lack of real-time communication options available on the platform, as well as the need for personal information in order to access features such as Messenger and advertising. I want a platform where I can connect with people without feeling like I am being tracked or sold more things than I want."
Gathering info on its client base and selling this information to the highest bidder is an evil practice. Facebook is a company that takes advantage of its users and attempts to manipulate public opinion and police thought. Screw these guys,2,"As a user, I want to ensure my personal information is secure when using Facebook's platform, so that I can feel confident in sharing updates and photos without fear of being exploited for advertising purposes."
"I hate Facebook. I used to love this platform. Im deleting my account that Ive had for over a decade. Id rather lose touch with people than give Facebook and more minute of my time, or allowing them to make another dollar off of my personal data. 

Mark Zuckerberg and his company have ruined the world. I hope they get whats coming to them because this whistleblower is right. FB is pissing people off on purpose to keep them scrolling. Shame!",2,"
As a user who previously enjoyed using Facebook, I am now deleting my account due to the company's negligence and disregard for user privacy. The constant stream of ads, the lack of control over personal data, and the recent changes to the platform's terms of service have all contributed to my decision. I hope that Mark Zuckerberg and his team are held accountable for their actions and that Facebook can be reformed to provide a better user experience."

I would like the ability to remove these videos from appearing on the app and have the option to choose which features I want to see and which I don't."
Zuckerberg is a sellout impeding our right to free speech to match their agenda. I only use because friends and family use. Seek a better platform this one is a privacy mining political agenda serving trash can.,1,"

I would really love a Facebook will update their app for the iPad so that I could create an avatar and stop getting the message it needs to be updated. I would also like for Facebook to stop sharing my information when I make it private and for my use only Im tired of seeing ads based off of my age which is a private and all the other crap ads based off of location that is again private. Get your act together Facebook. I want to see my friends posts not ads and posts from three and four days ago.,2,"
As a user, I would love it if Meta (Facebook) updated their app for iPads so I could make an avatar and stop getting the message that needs to be updated. I would also like for Meta to stop sharing my information when I make it private and use only, because I'm tired of seeing ads based off of my age which is a private and all the other crap ads based off of location, which is again private. I want to see my friends' posts not ads and posts from three and four days ago."
"Facebook please make a feature like Instagram has, for our highlights and stories we have on Facebook we should be able to see who watches our highlights and stories it should show everyone regardless if youre not friends with someone on the app for OUR OWN SAFETY and PRIVACY. Some people have legitimate people that want to hurt them, you guys need to make a feature where we can see who watches our highlights and our story even if we are not friends on Facebook. It shouldnt be anonymous its not fair. People can stock us, and they get protected?? yeah no.",2,"As a user of Facebook, I would like to have the ability to see who is watching my highlights and stories on the platform, regardless of whether or not we are friends. This feature would provide me with a better understanding of who is interested in my content and help me protect myself from potential threats."
I finally updated my Facebook to see if it fixed this .. it hasn't. I am unable to share onto my personal page from my photography business page. When i type in my name with  Without  sign. Very annoying to those of us that need that function.  Its been over a month! Im still a bit shy of 250. I have to post to my personal page separately .. and then link  sign to go to my business page. Most dont!,2,"
As a user of the Facebook platform, I want to be able to share content from my photography business page onto my personal page without having to manually post it there first and then link back to my business page. This functionality has been missing for over a month now, and it is very frustrating that I am unable to use it despite trying to update Facebook multiple times."
So many flaws regarding listing on marketplace to different buy sell groups. Also today I am unable to send any photos or videos on FB or messenger and it is telling me I need to give it access via setting but there is no option to change this. So frustrating.,2,"As a user, I want to be able to list my products on different buying and selling groups in the marketplace without any issues or flaws. I also want to be able to send photos or videos through Facebook Messenger or other messaging apps with ease. However, right now, I am unable to do so due to restrictions imposed by the platform. This is very frustrating and causes unnecessary stress for me as a user."
Horrible business practices. AntiAmerican antidemocracy. App wants all my data just to function properly. Started getting ads for things that I spoke about around my phone and never actually typed into my phone.,2,"As a user, I am very disappointed with the business practices of this platform/website. The app has been using my personal data without my consent, and it is not respecting my privacy. It seems to be anti-American and antidemocratic because it's collecting all my data without my permission. It started showing me ads for things I spoke about on my phone when I didn't even type them in. This behavior is unacceptable, and I demand that the app comply with my privacy rights and respect my democratic right to freedom of speech."
"Facebook is not safe anymore. Nobody can have personal online privacy without local or unknown people placing their force fed unwanted advertising or personal blogging junk on others newsfeeds. Nobody can express themselves and their entitled opinions anymore without someone feeling so offended that they have to cry like a little 5 yr to Facebook admins as if the sky was about to fall on them. Facebooks community standards are nothing but a joke. Whats the purpose of having Facebook, Twitter and so on if one cant enjoy themselves safely and securely?",2,"
As a user who values privacy and safety on social media platforms, I am frustrated by the lack of control I have over my online presence when using Facebook. I cannot express myself or share my opinions without fear of someone feeling offended and reporting me to Facebook administrators, leading to a barrage of unwanted advertising and personal blogging on my newsfeed. This makes it difficult for me to have a safe and secure online experience.

I believe that Facebook should prioritize the safety and privacy of its users by implementing stricter community standards and providing more effective moderation tools to protect against online harassment and inappropriate content. Additionally, I would like to see Facebook invest more resources into creating a safer and more private platform for all users."

send my photo ID to them and it let me change my password but i can not get into it because it requires a 6 digit code that is not coming to my phone!!! I guess my hacker changed my phone number so i cant get into it to find out. I sent sooooo

When I tried to change my password using the hacker's provided contact information, it required a six-digit code that is not being sent to my phone. This makes it impossible for me to access my profile and take necessary steps to protect myself from further harassment and identity theft.
I have been in contact with Facebook support, but I have not received any assistance or resolution to this issue. My hacker has also changed my profile picture without my permission, which has caused embarrassment for me and made it difficult for me to maintain a sense of privacy and control over my online identity."
"Ive had my account hacked and money tried to spend through Facebook Pay and have gotten zero support. If your app is going to allow people to steal money from them, then give us a spot to report the illegal theft!!!!!",2,"
User Story: As a user who has had their account hacked and attempted fraudulent transactions made through Facebook Pay, I would like to have a way to report this kind of activity so that it can be addressed by the app's support team."
"Forces you to use terrible 2factor authentication, and then when it doesnt send you a code to your app, you have to SEND THEM A PICTURE OF YOUR ID to get back into your account.

Not to mention that the app itself is disgusting bloatware  spyware that tracks you across everything else you do on your phone, even though Facebook lies and says they dont do that.",2,"As a user of the platform/website, I am frustrated with the inability to receive verification codes via text message due to poor two-factor authentication. Despite assurances from Facebook that they don't track users' activities, my information is being used by the app for nefarious purposes.

I would like a solution that ensures the security and privacy of my account, while also improving the user experience with respect to two-factor authentication."
"The app keeps getting updated to where if you run a page, its impossible to do anything.

"As of this latest update, Aug 20th, 2022, I am unable to update a post on my personal page or on a business page. If a mistake is found I have to delete and repost it. You are only able to update the privacy settings. This is frankly quite problematic",2,"
As a user of Instagram, I want the ability to easily update my posts without having to delete and repost them. If an error is found on a post, I should be able to correct it and have it updated accordingly. Currently, I am unable to do this on my personal page or business page, which makes it difficult for me to maintain accurate information on my social media presence."
I got locked out of my Facebook account and now Facebook will not let me back in unless I send them a picture of my drivers license or passport. Why does a social media website need my identification cards? I dont want Facebook selling my driver license information to other companies.,2,"
As a user, I am frustrated that I cannot log into my Facebook account without providing additional identification such as a driver's license or passport. This is an invasion of privacy and an unnecessary step that restricts my ability to access my own account. I do not want Facebook selling my driver's license information to other companies, and I expect better security measures from a social media website. I hope Facebook will make necessary changes to improve the security of its users' accounts."

As a user of Facebook, I want Facebook to stand up for the Constitution's rights for all users."
My account has been hacked and someone changed my email and it is impossible to get any assistance in correcting the matter. To make things worse I had a very close family member pass away and all of my favorite pictures right no longer have access to.I am extremely disappointed and would urge all others to ban Facebook Until they have a better security system in place.,2,"
As a user, I want the ability to change my email address on Facebook so that I can regain control over my account and access to my favorite pictures. Currently, my email address has been hacked and someone has changed it without my permission, which makes it impossible for me to get any assistance in correcting the matter. This issue is causing me significant emotional distress and I believe it's essential that Facebook takes immediate action to improve their security measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future."
"Facebook, you can change the culture, facilitate revolutions in foreign countries, influence US elections, and be the sole arbitrator for what content can be seen on your communication tool that is used by millions around the globe, but you cant help me to regain access to my FB account that has been hijacked by someone using a hotmail account despite my following all of your protocols.",2,"
As a user who uses Facebook regularly and follows its safety protocols, I am frustrated that I have not been able to regain control of my account after it was hijacked by someone using a Hotmail address. Despite following all of Facebook's safety protocols, including changing my password and enabling two-factor authentication, the hijacker has still managed to gain access to my account and make changes that I did not authorize.

As a user, I would like Facebook to provide me with the ability to regain control of my account if it has been compromised by someone else using a Hotmail address or any other email provider. This could involve providing additional security measures such as phone authentication or CAPTCHA challenges to help prevent unauthorized access to accounts. Additionally, Facebook should communicate with users who have had their accounts hijacked in this way and provide them with the necessary steps to regain control of their account."

I want to be able to use the app with a privacy-respecting browser like Brave, not Edge or Chrome which allow third party cookies and tracking to be turned off.

The company should make it clear on their app store page that they are invading my privacy and violating my rights by collecting and using personal data without my consent. "
"Facebook has continually showed that it is possible to fail over and over again with regards to privacy, corporate governance, moderation and also pushing extremism. One of the worst apps ever created for this store and a chapter we all hope to close on the Web 2.0 days soon.",2,"As a user, I want the website to have robust privacy features that protect my personal information from being misused or shared without my consent.

Do the research  hundreds of account having the same hacking issue even though they consider themselves secure.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am deeply concerned about my security and privacy on the platform. Recently, I discovered that my account had been hacked in the middle of the night, despite using two-factor authentication. The hacker managed to bypass this measure and gain access to my account. As a result, I am unable to log back into my account that I have had since the beginning of Facebook.

I have tried reaching out to customer support through various channels, including email, chat, and phone, but their response has been inadequate and frustrating. The help desk seems to bring me around in circles with no resolution being found. In fact, I have discovered that hundreds of other accounts have experienced similar issues despite considering themselves secure.

I urge Facebook to take immediate action to address this issue and provide adequate support to affected users."

Looking at my notification badge and it says I have 66 new notifications. When I open it up it only says I have 2. What is the problem with the discrepancy? Fix this and you get more stars. Also why no landscape mode on the iPhone? It works fine on iPad. Update 2 facebooks privacy issues have basically fixed me to keep this at a one star rating. Also its policy of misinformation and blocking the truth.,2,"

This is causing me to lose focus and be unable to effectively use the platform. I would like for the platform to fix this issue so that I can continue to use it without any further disruptions.

Additionally, I am disappointed by the lack of landscape mode on my iPhone. While the website works fine on an iPad in landscape mode, it does not provide the same experience on a smaller device. I would appreciate it if the platform could offer this feature to better cater to users with smaller screen sizes and improve overall usability."
"If i could i would give it a 0
Facebook has gone downhill in a fast and unethical way. They dont care about the user per se but rather the users analytics  data. This app is nothing more than a tracker that unfortunately even tracks your offline activity just so they can sell your info. If you value privacy and your 1st Amendment Right to Free Speech, then THIS APP IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU!! Nothing more than spambloatware",1,"
As a user who values privacy and free speech, I am appalled by the lack of respect for my online activity and analytics data on Facebook.

"My Husbands account was hacked after having it for 15 years. Someone made an inappropriate post, and they locked his account for review. They never sent a single notification or email. He waited for two months while his account was under review with absolutely no steps or actions provided for resolution. Never received a single communication about the process. If I hadnt seen that his account was hacked by a random post he didnt make he would have no idea what happened and no way to protect his information. After all of this time, he just received notification that his account has been permanently disabled, because too much time has elapsed to review his account. Excuse me?? What have you been doing for two months?! This is just terrible business practices, youre too busy stealing data to care for your users. TERRIBLE BUSINESS, lackadaisical practices and good riddance!

"Do not even get into Facebook. Frankly, I wish that I never set up an account. The email and phone you give it will track your purchases on your credit card. Not even kidding.

I also want the ability to fact-check information before sharing it with others. However, my ability to do so has been limited by the overabundance of ""fact checkers"" and the strict rules surrounding what is allowed on social media. This has led to a decrease in the overall quality of posts and conversations on these platforms, as well as an increase in the spread of misinformation.

To fix this problem, I would like to see social media platforms prioritize user-generated content and allow for more fact-checking mechanisms to be implemented. This could include algorithms that help identify and flag potentially false information, as well as the ability for users to report suspicious posts for removal. Additionally, social media companies should work to reduce the number of ""fact checkers"" on their platforms and give users more control over what content they see."

"Facebook is an evil globalist spy entity engaged in outright social engineering and manipulation of the wordwide population. 

With more power than any of the early 20th century monopolies, Facebook is the manifestation of an OrwellianHuxleyesque dystopic nightmare that infects and afflicts and subverts humanity and all core values of freedom of speech and association, individual rights, privacy, etc. 

This is a demonic bastardization of all of the good that this technology could provide. 

All involved should be ashamed... AND IN PRISON.",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated by Facebook's attempts to manipulate and control my personal information and data collection practices. The platform has a massive amount of power over me and my friends, and it is not transparent about how they collect and use our data. This lack of transparency makes me feel uneasy and concerned about the privacy of my personal information.

I am also disturbed by Facebook's manipulation of the wordwide population through its algorithms and news feed. The platform has a tendency to show me content that I would not normally be interested in, and it is biased towards certain groups and individuals that I am not connected with. This makes me feel disconnected from my own community and makes it difficult for me to form meaningful connections with others.

Overall, I believe that Facebook's actions are a threat to individual rights, privacy, and freedom of speech. It is a shame that such a powerful platform has been used in this way, and all involved should be held accountable for their actions."

"There are well detailed complaints already posted about the failings of Facebook. We've long been aware of the crimes and offenses of the Zuckerberg lead company. Our hope is that their spying, stealing, and general indifference to you and us catches up with them, and that they come to realize their egregious offenses, which are perpetrated against us, freedom, and the privileges they enjoy but deprive of others, such as privacy.

They use their platform to harass people, will not allow you to delete your profile, if you do not agree with their infringement of your 1st amendment rights, they allow your profile to ne hacked and allow the hackers to pretend they are you.

There is no way to directly contact someone and even though several people have reported my Facebook as hacked they still have not done anything about it. The guy who hacked my Facebook is conversating, laughing, and messing with my friends and family including my kid. Thinking this who thing is a joke. I have personal information on my Facebook and they are not protecting my privacy. I am scared for my safety and the information he most liky accessed including my home address. They need to figure out a better system and take care of issues like this immediately. They want to kick people off for petty issues but will not help resolve important issues. Facebook is a good way for keeping in touch with family and friends but they do not ensure your safety or privacy like they say they do.",1,"As a user, I have positive feelings towards the platform due to its utility as a means of communication. However, the customer support provided falls short of my expectations. The company's claims that it prioritizes users' privacy and safety are false, as I have personally witnessed instances where my personal information has been accessed without my consent. I have had my account hacked along with several other users, despite multiple reports to the company. There is no direct way for me to communicate with the person responsible for the breach, leaving me feeling vulnerable and unsafe. The person who hacked my account is still in contact with friends and family members, including my child, which I consider a violation of their privacy and safety as well. I urge the company to develop more robust security measures and address issues like this immediately."

As a social media user who has been using the platform for over a year, I am extremely disappointed with its recent changes that have compromised my privacy and safety. Despite the promises of increased security and safety features, I have noticed that my personal information is being misused and shared without my consent.

As a result, I am considering leaving the platform altogether, as it no longer feels safe or trustworthy to me. Despite this, I hope that the developers will take my concerns seriously and make changes to improve user privacy and safety in the future."
If I wanted the government spying on me and having access to all my stuff I would live in China.

Shameful!",2,"
As a user, I want to be able to express my thoughts and opinions without fear of retribution or censorship.

I want to be able to post content that is respectful and truthful, but if it is deemed offensive by Facebook, they should not have the ability to delete my account or suspend it indefinitely.

It is disheartening when there are individuals who are forced to hide their true identities and are left feeling isolated and unheard. I want to be able to engage in conversations without worrying about how my words will be perceived or what consequences may arise from them. I also want to have the ability to share my thoughts and opinions freely, without fear of backlash or criticism.

Facebook is complete and utter communist propaganda. They will allow popular  stories that  make the communist party look wonderful but censor the negative issues about China like they use  slaves to make  goods for first world  countries.

Went from good to rotten due to their corrupt practices.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am no longer satisfied with the platform's service. Despite being a daily user, I have had to change my password multiple times as it refused to accept my login information.

"Just because I watch one video, doesnt mean I want to keep watching the same content creator or close to the same videos. People like a variety. I hate this feature of you tracking everything I watch online. I watched 2 videos of a creator and the next day my feed was full of nothing but their videos. This is what makes people unfollow some creators.",2,"As an user, I want to have access to a wide variety of content on the platform so that I can enjoy different types of videos from various creators without getting bored of watching the same content over and over again.
I want the platform to stop tracking my viewing history so that I can enjoy the content without any interference from the algorithm.
Currently, the algorithm is too focused on recommending content based on what I have already watched, which results in me getting bored of watching videos from one creator and not enjoying other types of content as much.
I would appreciate it if you could provide more recommendations based on my viewing history rather than solely relying on the algorithm to generate recommendations."
It is SO infuriating FB refuses access to all Created Friends Lists in app!! Ridiculous!! Not all of us own computers so we can actually use fb properly!! Mobile fb website is now useless with new update!! No access to any settings or left side bar on mobile site!! We want classic full desktop site access in mobile Safari!!,2,"As a Facebook user, I am frustrated when the platform refuses access to my friends list. I rely on my friends list for social connections and need to see all of them. The new update has made it so that only a few people can access the friends list. This is not only frustrating but also creates barriers in using the platform.

I want Facebook to allow me to access my friends list from any device, including mobile phones, without any restrictions or limitations. I want to be able to use the platform in the way that suits me best, which includes seeing all of my friends and their details.

They deserve less than one star rating. They have gotten to big for their own good. They want to control what we post and see. What we buy by suggesting items they have tracked across apps.

This app is horrible. There is no freedom of speech with them they constantly block your posts if it doesnt line up with their thoughts or beliefs. Constant monitoring of what you say or do. The whole thing should be deemed a violation of privacy and they should be shut down permanently!!!,2,"

I had to create a new business page, and facebook wont even let me create a new one! It just keep saying query error. Absolutely disgusting that a company is allowed to have absolutely zero customer service, no live support chat, no phone number, no one to respond to emails, nothing. Honestly I cant wait for a better platform to come out and put facebook in the ground. Or someone who knows what theyre doing to take over facebook and make necessary changes.",2,"
As a user of Facebook, I am extremely dissatisfied with the level of customer service provided by the platform. In particular, my experience with creating a new business page has been frustrating and unhelpful. Despite my attempts to reach out to support, I have received no response or resolution to the issue. This is unacceptable for a company that claims to provide a platform for businesses to connect with their customers. I am forced to create a new business page every time I need to restore access to my previous one. The lack of support and communication from Facebook makes it clear that they do not care about their users or their needs. I can only hope that a better platform will arise soon, allowing me to move away from this disgusting platform."
"Why are other people allowed to share MY postphoto but I cant see it because of THEIR privacy settings? How does that make any sense when its my content to begin with? How do I know Im not being bashed or made fun of?! If someone shares my stuff, I should be able to see it. Period. Also, if you want people to use Reels more professionally make it so we can choose our own cover photo for the reel cause the ones you all choose are awful. And almost all of my reels are muted with copyright claims. I chose songs from the available library you all have for your users using the Audio function. Why is this happening?! Update this, please! Can we be more uptodate like TikTok and Instagram? I mean, dont yall own Instagram? Come on now. The reels for Facebook is such an outdated editing feature. Oh, and thank you! I do love Facebook.",2,"As a user of Facebook, I am frustrated by the lack of control I have over my content when it comes to sharing it on the platform. Specifically, I am upset that other users are able to share my posts without my consent, even though I have set my privacy settings to only allow certain groups or individuals to see them. This goes against my trust in the platform and makes me feel like I am being targeted or manipulated.

Additionally, I am disappointed in the editing features available on Facebook Reels. The options for choosing a cover photo are limited, and many of my reels are muted due to copyright claims. I would appreciate it if the platform could be updated to better align with the uptodate features of other social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

Overall, I would like Facebook to prioritize user privacy and provide more control over my content when sharing it on the platform."
"So many glitches and the advertising is completely out of control. They are already stealing all of our personal information in exchange for using their app, and now they are harassing us with ads every 1 to 2 posts. Ridiculous.",2,"
As a user, I am frustrated by the glitches on this platform and the excessive advertising that is disrupting my experience. The app's focus on data collection and advertising has made me question its trustworthiness and privacy policies. I hope to see improvements in these areas."
"My account was cloned even after setting up two party authentication and changing password to an impossible to guess series of letters, numbers, and symbols. Settings for privacy and notifications dont work, so I shouldnt be surprised. A myriad of problems with this app, plus the fact its owned by an evil communist.",2,"As a user, I want to be able to access my account without it being cloned or compromised, even when using two-factor authentication and a strong password. I also want my privacy settings and notifications to work correctly, as I should not be surprised by the issues with this app and its ownership."
"After the election results I left Facebook app. permanently. They sold our information, spied on our private messages, censored conservative voices, interfered in our elections. Im sick that after many years of supporting them they betrayed us conservatives. I cant support this app anymore. Im out.",2,"
As a conservative user who is frustrated with the Facebook app's handling of their information and political views, I want to permanently delete my account and end my association with the platform. Specifically, I am upset about Facebook's attempts to censor conservative voices and monitor private messages, as well as their selling of user data without my consent. I cannot support this app anymore and would like to see changes made to prevent similar betrayals in the future."
