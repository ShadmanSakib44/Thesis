"After the last two updates, the app stopp taking record of my sleep time automatically.... I kindly advice the developers to see to that...",Samsung Health,problem_report,"As a user, I want the app to automatically track my sleep time again so that I don't have to manually record it or experience a disruption in functionality."
"I bought this thinking i could use this for open water swimming. Far from efficient, as i couldnt close the app after i finished. Would have been great to have been able to tell the actual water temp too. Also the sleep function is ineffective.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of that review into multiple user stories:

*   **As an open water swimmer, I want to be able to close the app easily after finishing my swim so I can quickly move on to other tasks.**
*   **As an open water swimmer, I want the app to display the current water temperature so I can assess the safety and comfort of my swim.**

Disappointed with this app. No way to install additional watch faces unless you download the moded chinese version. Why is this app not regularly updated?,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's a conversion of the review into user stories, broken down for clarity:

**User Story 1 (Addressing Watch Faces):**

""As a user, I want to be able to install additional watch faces through the official app or a supported method, so I don't have to rely on potentially risky or unofficial sources.""

**User Story 2 (Addressing Lack of Updates):**

""As a user, I want the app to be regularly updated with new features, bug fixes, and security improvements, so I can be confident that the app is well-maintained and secure."""
"I used to love this app.. now it dosent even work properly. It dosent even count my steps sometime.. really frustrating, also weight management feature is no longer there with the new update.. pointless having this app anymore..",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories we can derive from that review, addressing different aspects of the user's feedback:

*   **User Story 1 (Addressing step counting):** ""As a user, I want the app to accurately track my steps so that I can monitor my activity levels reliably.""

*   **User Story 2 (Addressing weight management):** ""As a user, I want access to the weight management feature, so that I can reliably track my weight and achieve my weight-loss goals.""

*   **User Story 3 (Addressing overall app reliability- can be used in addition to the above):** ""As a user, I want the app to function reliably and as expected, so I don't experience frustration and can depend on it."""
Does the job. But my floor count is so inaccurate the last 4 weeks. Vivosmart keeps saying I've climed 35+ floors everyday when its more like 10-15 floor.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"As a user, I want the Vivosmart to accurately track the number of floors I've climbed so that I can have a reliable record of my activity."
My activities from My Fitness Pal don't sync into the Connect app. I'm having to enter my workouts manually.  My information such as my picture or personal stats/settings are saving some and not others. My screens look nothing like any of the screenshots or videos.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story:

**Understanding the Review:**

The user is experiencing several issues:

*   **Syncing Problem:** Data from My Fitness Pal (MFP) is not syncing with the Connect app.
*   **Inconsistent Saving:** Profile information (picture, personal stats, settings) are inconsistently saved.
*   **UI Discrepancy:** The user interface (screens) of the app doesn't match the advertised version.

**User Story:**

We can break this down into multiple user stories, but here is one that attempts to capture the essence of the problem:

""As a user, I want my data to seamlessly sync between My Fitness Pal and the Connect app so I don't have to manually enter my workout data and my profile always reflects my most recent settings and information.""

**Alternative (More Granular) User Stories:**

To be more specific (and therefore likely better for development), we can create several user stories. This also allows for prioritizing and addressing issues separately:

*   ""As a user, I want the Connect app to automatically sync my workout data from My Fitness Pal so I don't have to manually enter it.""
*   ""As a user, I want my profile picture, personal stats, and settings within the Connect app to be consistently saved and displayed correctly.""
*   ""As a user, I want the Connect app's user interface to match the screenshots and videos advertised so I can easily navigate and use the app's features."""
Aftsr latest update gt2 doesnt connect to internet. Cannot show weather data and cant check for update... Also cant change watch faces. Also probkems in help page... Simply notngood,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story based on it:

**Breakdown of the Review:**

*   **Internet Connectivity Issues:** After the update, the device (GT2) cannot connect to the internet. This prevents:
    *   Displaying weather data
    *   Checking for updates
*   **Watch Face Issues:** Unable to change watch faces.
*   **Help Page Issues:** Problems with the help page functionality

**User Story:**

**As a user, I want my GT2 device to maintain a stable internet connection after updates so that I can continue to receive weather data, check for updates, and change watch faces without interruption.**

**Alternatively, you could break it down into multiple user stories:**

*   **As a user, I want my GT2 device to reconnect and maintain a stable internet connection after updates so that I can receive accurate and up-to-date weather information.**
*   **As a user, I want my GT2 device to be able to get software updates through an internet connection so that I can receive the latest features and bug fixes.**
*   **As a user, I want to be able to change the watch face on my GT2 device so that I can personalize my device.**
*   **As a user, I want the Help page to work as expected so I can solve problems I face.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   The single combined user story above prioritizes the core problem (interrupted functionality) and ties the sub-issues (weather, updates, and watch faces) together as examples of what is impacted.
*   The alternative set of user stories breaks the problem down further, which might be useful for prioritizing individual fixes.
*   I omitted the ""simply notngood"" part as it's an opinion, not a specific requirement.

The best approach depends on how you want to track and address the issues. Breaking them down can be useful for developers."
I have installed and uninstalled this app 12 times and it still doesnt work. When I click on 'Sign in' it just goes blank. I have watched the Youtube trouble shooting tutorials also. Does not work.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"As a user, I want to be able to sign in to the app successfully so that I can access its features, even after installing and uninstalling it, and troubleshooting with available tutorials."
"The app says one of the accessories is a samsung heart rate monitor so I ordered it,  doesn't use the heart rate monitor for anything,  big bummer and misleading",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a couple of options, depending on which aspect of the review you want to emphasize:

**Option 1 (Focus on Misleading Information):**

""As a user, I want the app to accurately describe compatible accessories and their functionalities so that I am not misled into purchasing accessories that are not fully supported.""

**Option 2 (Focus on Lack of Heart Rate Monitor Functionality):**

""As a user, I want the app to utilize the data from compatible heart rate monitors, like the Samsung heart rate monitor, so that I can track my heart rate during activities and gain insights into my fitness."""
Im often using this apps for physical activity daily drive.... But the result was not significant ... Long run about 45 minutes.... And the result. 51% walk.. 49% running...for 8 kilometres...

it can't  be used in other devices.. samsung should open this types  of software to alll,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here's a possible user story based on the review, keeping in mind the slightly unclear nature of the original comment:

Previous version was better! Cant even get on this updated one. Plus I've lost all data by looks of it,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a possible user story based on the review, broken down for clarity and with an option for a second, more specific story:

**Option 1 (Broad):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to function properly after an update, so that I can continue to access my data and use the app as before.""

**Option 2 (More Specific - Breaking into Two Stories):**

*   ""As a user, I want the updated app to allow me to log in successfully, so I can use the new version.""
*   ""As a user, I want my existing data to be preserved during an app update, so I don't lose any information.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Option 1** captures the overall sentiment of frustration: the user wants the updated app to simply work without data loss.

*   **Option 2** focuses on the two specific issues the user mentions: broken logins and lost data. This is helpful for developers to prioritize and address each problem separately. Breaking larger stories into smaller, more manageable tasks is often a good practice. If the data loss is particularly significant or requires a complex restoration process, it may even warrant further decomposition into multiple stories related to preventing and recovering data loss."
Getting better and faster ... Keep it up.   Adding 7 minutes workout kind of activities with sample will be great feature.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"As a user, I want 7-minute workout activities with examples to be added to the app so that I have more variety in my workout options."

There is no option or updates given for honor band 4 regarding screen lock and also battery % of band in band itself,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story:

**Understanding the Review:**

The user has two main complaints:

*   **Screen Lock Options:** They want to be able to control screen locking (or lack thereof) on their Honor Band 4.
*   **Battery Percentage Display:** They want the Honor Band 4 to display the battery percentage directly on the band's screen.

**User Story Options (Prioritization Recommended):**

Since the review covers two separate features, it's best to create two distinct user stories. This allows for separate prioritization and development. 

One User Story:

*As a user of Honor Band 4, I want to have screen lock setting options, so I can adjust the display to my preferences.*

Another User Story:

*As a user of Honor Band 4, I want the band to display the battery percentage, so I can quickly check the battery level without using the app.*"

**User Story 1 (Addressing Conservative Sleep Stats):**

**User Story 2 (Addressing Offline Sync Issues):**

""As a user, I want the app to sync sleep data from my watch even when an internet connection is unavailable, so that I can capture my sleep data in remote locations and sync it later when connectivity is restored."""

Worst app ..I am not able to download even a single theme ....no clear user guide ... Update your app guys do some work..hate it 👎🏼,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a potential user story, addressing the key issues:

**Understanding the Review:**

This review has several pain points:

*   **Failed Theme Download:** The user cannot download themes.
*   **Lack of User Guide:** There's no clear instruction on how to use the app.
*   **General Dissatisfaction:**  Impatience and frustration.

**Generated User Stories:**

We can break this down into a few separate user stories to address each issue individually:

**User Story 1: Addressing Download Issues**

*   ""As a user, I want to be able to successfully download themes from the app so that I can customize my device.""

**User Story 2: Addressing the Lack of Guidance**

*   ""As a user, I want a clear and easy-to-understand user guide within the app so that I can learn how to use all of its features effectively.""

**Additional considerations**

Given the level of frustration in the review, it may also be useful to create a user story centered around troubleshooting errors.

*   ""As a user, I want the app to provide helpful error messages when I encounter problems, like failed downloads, so I can understand the issue and find a solution""

**Rationale:**

*The ""As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"" format helps focus the development team on the value of the feature to the user.* By breaking down the review into smaller user stories, developers can address the main points of pain and provide positive solutions with updates."

The hight and weight setting don't set properly, only fault.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"As a user, I want the app to accurately save and display my height and weight settings so that my workout data and charts are correct."
"How does it calculate calories? Walked 40 min with 4km/h speed. It is about 2.7km. And the app says me I burnt about 350 calories. How this even possible? In reality it would be 110-130 calories. Please, fix. Otherwise it is useless.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the converted user story based on the review:

""As a user, I want the app to accurately calculate calories burned during activities so that I can rely on the data for tracking my fitness goals."""
removed the caloric intake feature and now it's wack edit: just found out you can undo the update by looking up the older version of the app on the Samsung mobile website 😫 still upset the current version doesn't have the calorie intake and outake meter though,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a couple of user stories we can derive from the review, focusing on different aspects:

**User Story 1 (Focus on the missing feature):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to have a caloric intake and outtake meter so that I can easily track my calorie balance within the app.""

**User Story 2 (Focus on the downgrade workaround):**

* ""As a user, I should not need to download an old version of the app to access the calorie intake and outtake meter, so that I can have the latest updates while also accessing the features I want.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   The review clearly expresses the user's desire for the return of the calorie tracking feature. User Story 1 directly addresses this need.
*   The review specifically states workarounds they had to take, which is something an end user should not need to do. User Story 2 explains the need to focus on the workaround to get the feature."

**User Story 2 (Addressing the call log permission concern):**

""As a user, I want to understand why the app needs access to my call logs so that I can make an informed decision about granting the permission.""

**Explanation of the choices:**

*   **Splitting into Two Stories:**  The review actually covers two distinct issues. It's best to separate them into two stories so they can be addressed independently.
*   **Addressing Concerns:**  For the call log permission, the user isn't just stating a missing feature, but a concern. The user story reflects that by focusing on transparency and understanding."

3 messages in 4 hours now getting very annoying.stop it,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting the review ""3 messages in 4 hours now getting very annoying. stop it"" into a user story, keeping in mind the user's implied needs:

**Option 1 (Focus on limiting frequency):**

*   ""As a user, I want to receive notifications and messages at a less frequent rate, so I am not overwhelmed by excessive messages.""

**Option 3 (More specific, assuming message are not important):**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Option 1:** This is a broad interpretation, focusing on reduced number of messages.
*   **Option 2:** This option addresses a desire for more control, implying the user wants the ability to configure the notification frequency.
*   **Option 3:** This option is specifically about the importance of the messages themselves; that the user finds them unimportant, but important messages shouldn't be filtered."
Why does it not work on the Xiaomi MI4 phone? Seems strange that on a new phone it would not work.

Very good application. Everything is alright except navigating back to main page/my day page. Also finding some settings i.e. recording smart/par min is difficult. Make setting simple . It will be awesome.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story, split into multiple stories to cover the points:

**Understanding the Review:**

The review highlights two main issues:

1.  **Navigation:** Difficulty navigating back to the main page/ ""My Day"" page.
2.  **Settings:** Finding specific settings (like ""recording smart/par min"") is difficult; settings need to be simplified.

**User Stories:**

Here are two user stories addressing the points:

*   **User Story 1 (Navigation):** ""As a user, I want to easily navigate back to the main page/ 'My Day' page from any screen so that I can quickly return to the app's central view.""

*   **User Story 2 (Settings):** ""As a user, I want the settings to be organized and easy to find so that I can quickly configure the app to my preferences without difficulty."""
"there is no option in app for chane watch face style! i think u're limit some of option for some countries, and that is not fair! i Use the best model of huawei phone and smart watch but i can't use applicatins completely :(",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options, depending on the nuance you want to capture from the review:

**Option 1 (Focus on general watch face customization):**

""As a user, I want the ability to change the watch face style in the app so that I can personalize my device.""

**Option 2 (Focus on fairness and feature parity):**

""As a user, I want all available app features, including watch face style options, to be accessible regardless of my geographic location or device model so that I have a fair and complete user experience.""

**Option 3 (More specific, focused on the reported limitation):**

""As a user with a Huawei phone and smartwatch, I want to be able to change the watch face style via the app so that I can fully utilize the features I expect on my devices.""

**Explanation of the Choices:**

*   **Option 1** is the most general and covers the basic need expressed in the review.
*   **Option 2** addresses the deeper issue of perceived unfairness and feature limiting based on geo/device.
*   **Option 3** is the most specific, directly addressing the user's specific device combination and their expectation of feature availability.

Which option is best depends on the product owner's priorities and the broader context of the app's development. If the app intends to offer different features for different regions or devices, Option 2 would be more suitable. If the app does not differentiate based on region or device, Option 1 might be enough, while Option 3 might be best if this limitation is identified as a bug."
"Pls add anothers wallpaper widgets that able to open app in basic page, or add/record workout directly",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a couple of options for user stories based on the review, focusing on different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focusing on Widget Functionality):**

*   ""As a user, I want more wallpaper widgets that allow for direct app access from my home screen so I can quickly access basic app functions.""

**Option 2 (Focusing on Workout Options):**

*   ""As a user, I want the ability to start a workout directly from a wallpaper widget so that I can track my activity quickly and easily.""

**Explanation of choices:**

*   I split the review into two potential features (direct app access and workout recording), as they are distinct needs.
*   Each user story specifies the ""who"" (a user), the ""what"" (the desired functionality - widgets for either app access or workout recording), and the ""why"" (the benefit - quick access and easy tracking).
*   I interpreted ""basic page"" as referring to simplified, fundamental app functions. I also changed to ""app access"" instead of ""open app"" to be more comprehensive."
When everything works it is great. The weather app just suddenly decided to stop working. I didn't change anything on my phone or fitness tracker.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's a possible user story conversion of the review:

Do you actually read feedbacks? I've been reporting about the bugs in daily walking tab.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the review into a user story, depending on the nuance you want to capture:

**Option 1 (Focus on Bug Reporting):**

*   ""As a user, I want assurance that bug reports for the daily walking tab are being actively reviewed and addressed.""

**Option 2 (Focus on Bug Resolution):**

*   ""As a user, I want bugs in the daily walking tab to be fixed, so I can have a reliable and accurate tracking experience.""

**Option 3 (More Specific Focus):**

*   Assuming they are reporting specific bugs within that tab, and focusing on resolution: ""As a user, I want bugs in the daily walking tab to be resolved, so that they do not interfere with tracking and recording my walking activity.""

In each, the core user and need are addressed.

I recommend choosing the user story that best reflects the underlying need and desired outcome from the user's perspective."

Last update made my Garmin S62 watch stop receiving notifications. Phone are connected correct but not getting any notifications at all,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"As a Garmin S62 user, I want to receive notifications on my watch even after app updates, so I don't miss important alerts."
"It's a great app, could be more supportive of other non Samsung devices such as scales. But otherwise love it.",Samsung Health,feature_request,"As a user with a non-Samsung device (e.g., a scale), I want the app to be compatible with my device so that I can integrate its data with the app seamlessly."

*   **Issue 1 (Disconnections):** ""I don't know why my band gets disconnects automatically.""
*   **Issue 2 (Reply to Notifications):** ""And kindly try to enable the reply option to the notifications on honor band ES that will be much appreciated""

Therefore, these are the two User Stories:

*   **User Story 1:** ""As a user, I want my band to maintain a stable connection with my device so that I don't experience unexpected disconnections.""
*   **User Story 2:** ""As a user with an Honor Band ES, I want to be able to reply to notifications directly from my band so that I can quickly respond to messages without needing to use my phone.""

**Explanation of choices:**

* `As a user` to state the person using the product
*   We focus on the *desire* of the user, not just the problem.
*   We use the formula: _As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]._
*   We aim for clear and actionable language.
*   We extracted two user stories because the review described two different, unrelated requests from the user."
Please enable auto pause of tracking the exercise while stopping in between an exercise and start tracking automatically once the exercise is resumed.,Huawei Health,feature_request,"As a user, I want the app to automatically pause exercise tracking when I stop and automatically resume tracking when I resume my exercise, so I don't have to manually control the tracking during breaks."
Slow start up and slow operation why do you need Id now to work?,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a possible conversion of the review into a user story, broken down for clarity:

**Breaking down the review:**

*   **""Slow start up""**: The app is taking too long to start.
*   **""Slow operation""**: The app performs sluggishly, even after startup.
*   **""why do you need Id now to work?""**: The user objects to needing an ID to use the app.

**User Story Options** (You might choose one or split this into multiple stories depending on your development process):

**Option 1 (Focus on Performance):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to start quickly and operate smoothly so that I can complete my tasks efficiently.""

**Option 2 (Splitting Performance & ID Requirement):**

*   **Story 1 (Performance):** ""As a user, I want the app to start quickly and operate smoothly so that I can complete my tasks efficiently.""
*   **Story 2 (ID Requirement):**""As a User, I want a clear explanation for why I need to provide identification to use this app.""
*   **Story 3 (ID Requirement Alternative):** ""As a User, I want to be able to use this app without providing identification.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a user""**: This sets the perspective.
*   **""I want...""**: This states the user's desire.
*   **""so that...""**: This explains the user's motivation (the benefit of the feature).

**Which Option to Choose:**

*   If you are grouping slow startup and operation as a single performance concern, Option 1 would be the best approach.
*   If you want to deal these issues seperately and address the ID concern, Option 2 is best.
*   If the ID requirement is not entirely necessary, than Option 3 may be best to offer the core functionality of the app without needing an ID.

Ultimately, discuss your available resources and project priorities, and choose whatever works best for you."
"After updating app, it's not connecting, even it's not showing device, then i thought i have to reset it (Honor band5), then also not connecting, worst experience, worst app. Now this band became useless. You Busted why you people taking money from us.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories derived from that review, focusing on different aspects of the user's problem:

**Option 1 (Focus on the core connection issue):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to connect to my Honor Band 5 after an app update so that I can continue using its features.""

**Option 2 (Focusing on the frustration and perceived unreliability):**

*   ""As a user, I want app updates to be thoroughly tested to maintain the device connection and functionality without needing to reset my device or have the device become useless.""

**Option 3 (More detailed, breaking down the problem):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to automatically recognize and connect to my Honor Band 5 after an update, so I can avoid connectivity problems and device resets.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   I tried to avoid the accusatory language in the review (""You Busted why you people taking money from us."") and focus on the underlying need.
*   The core issue seems to be the connection failure, especially after an update. So, that became the focus of the first option.
* The second and third options acknowledge the severity of the issue leading to the device becoming unusable and the steps the user had to take to try and resolve it.

Ultimately, which user story is ""best"" depends on the specific priorities of the development team. Option 1 is the most concise, while Option 3 captures more detail about the user's experience. If device connection after updates is a known area of weakness, Option 2 might be preferable."
I can't access the app appeantley my phone is rooted but is not,Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a couple of options, depending on what the ""rooting"" restriction is about.

**Option 1 (Focus on access):**

""As a user, I want to be able to access the app even if my phone is incorrectly identified as rooted, so I can use the app on my device.""

**Option 2 (Focus on identifying root status correctly):**

""As a developer, I want the app to accurately detect the root status of a user's device so that users are not incorrectly blocked from accessing the app.""

**Reasoning for the Options:**

*   The user is saying the app is wrong about them being rooted.
*   Option 1 focuses on the user and what they want to achieve.
*   Option 2 focuses on fixing the incorrect identification within the system.

    You'd need to know the context of *why* the app cares about whether the phone is rooted - is it a security concern? Is it a compatibility issue? The best user story will reflect that reasoning."
"I enjoy the app, especially logging food. Would be nice if app would allow more than 100 My Food entries to be added/created.",Samsung Health,feature_request,"As a user, I want to be able to add and create more than 100 My Food entries so that I can log a wider variety of custom foods I eat."
Some minor issues found in your app.  If i shake my phone it count steps.

"FIXED SD CARD ISSUE: App won't install stuck on ""downloading"" with no installation bar or anything in the notification tray  Software eject SD card to fix for some reason it only affected the installation of this app",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the review into a user story, depending on how specific you want to be:

**Option 1 (Focus on the installation issue):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to install correctly to my device, regardless of whether I'm using an SD card, so that I can access and use the app after downloading it.**

**Option 2 (More specific to the SD card):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to install the app on my SD card without encountering installation errors or being stuck in the ""downloading"" state, so that I can fully utilize my device's storage capacity.**

**Option 3 (Broader, encompassing the installation progress issue):**

*   **As a user, I want to see clear and accurate installation progress indicators (such as a progress bar) during the app installation process, so that I know the app is installing correctly and how much longer it will take.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   **Option 1** is a wider catch-all. It addresses the core problem: the app isn't installing correctly.
*   **Option 2** is more specific to the SD card issue mentioned. This might be useful if the developers believe the SD card interaction is where the bug lies.
*   **Option 3** takes a little broader approach based on another part of the review. It is about having more information as a user because the process wasn't providing the right details."
Only complaint is when watch disconnects' becasue i got too far from phone (30+') it wont automatically reconnect...other then that still learning so hope to rate higher then 3☆ later,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"As a user, I want my watch to automatically reconnect to my phone when back in range after a disconnection, so that I don't have to manually reconnect them."
Why all the foods are conserved food.I cook in home.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a couple of options, depending on the possible interpretation of ""conserved food"":

**Option 1 (Assuming ""conserved food"" means pre-packaged/processed food):**

*   **User Story:** ""As a user, I want to see more home-cooked style meal options so that I have alternatives to pre-packaged/processed food.""

**Option 2 (Assuming ""conserved food"" means ingredients listed that are not fresh):**

*   **User Story:** ""As a user, I want to see the app feature meals with fresh ingredients so that I can easily find options closer to what I cook at home.""

**Explanation of the choices:**

The review expresses dissatisfaction with the type of food listed. The user appears to be looking for something more akin to home-cooked meals.

*   **Option 1** focuses on ""home-cooked style"" food as the primary desire.  It assumes the user is unhappy with the prevalence of processed or packaged foods.

*   **Option 2** focuses on the ingredients that the user expects to use, assuming that the ingredients on the app are listed as not fresh.

Both options attempt to capture the user's need for meals that resonate with their home cooking preferences. Which is more appropriate depends on clarifying the user's deeper meaning of ""conserved food""."
"App looks good but the settings don't take effect immediately, setting profile specific information",Huawei Health,feature_request,"As a user, I want profile settings to apply immediately so I can see the changes I've made without delay."

Improve ur app man and add some more features to smartwatch ui it getting boring add camera shutter and voice assistant and add feature to stop continues heart rate monitor change navigation animation and add drink water reminder etc,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Okay, here's a breakdown of the review and a potential user story (or stories, since it's really asking for multiple features):

**Breaking down the review:**

The review is essentially asking for several enhancements to a smartwatch app:

*   **""Improve ur app man and add some more features to smartwatch ui it getting boring""**: This is a general statement about wanting more features and improved UI.
*   **""add camera shutter""**: Request for remote camera shutter control
*   **""and voice assistant""**: Request for voice assistant integration
*   **""and add feature to stop continues heart rate monitor""**: Request to disable continuous heart rate monitoring
*   **""change navigation animation""**: Request to change UI navigation animation
*   **""and add drink water reminder etc""**: Request for a drink water reminder feature

**Derived User Stories:**

Because this review has several requests, it's better to break it down into separate user stories for easier management:

*   **User Story 1 (Camera Shutter):** ""As a smartwatch user, I want a remote camera shutter feature so I can easily take photos with my phone from my watch.""

*   **User Story 2 (Voice Assistant):** ""As a smartwatch user, I want to be able to access a voice assistant through my watch so that I can control my phone and get information hands-free.""

*   **User Story 3 (Disable Continuous Heart Rate):** ""As a smartwatch user, I want the option to disable continuous heart rate monitoring so that I can conserve battery life.""

*   **User Story 4 (Navigation Animation):** ""As a smartwatch user, I want improved navigation animations on the watch UI so the experience is more engaging and visually appealing.""

*   **User Story 5 (Drink Water Reminder):** ""As a smartwatch user, I want a drink water reminder feature so that I am prompted to stay hydrated throughout the day.""

**A more general optional story:**

*   **User Story 6 (General UI Improvement):** ""As a smartwatch user, I want the smartwatch UI to be updated with new features and interface improvements regularly so that the experience is more engaging and useful.""

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Prioritization:** These stories should be prioritized based on user impact, development effort, and business goals.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Each user story should have clear acceptance criteria (how you'll know when the story is ""done""). For example, for the camera shutter story, an acceptance criterion might be ""The smartwatch app should be able to trigger the phone's camera to take a picture.""
*   **Further Clarification:** The product owner might need to discuss these requests in more detail to fully understand the user's needs and the desired implementation."
Why did you take away the average weight stats for weekly and monthly. Now I can only see daily. Worst update ever. Now I will have to find another app with those features!,Samsung Health,feature_request,"As a user who tracks weight, I want to see average weight statistics for weekly and monthly periods (in addition to daily) so that I can easily track my long-term weight trends and avoid switching to another application."
The sleep app is not updating on my android phone. It suddenly stopped. The watch Huawei GT 2 is good. But there seems to be bug in the App.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"As a user with a Huawei GT 2 watch and an Android phone, I want the sleep data from my watch to consistently sync with the sleep app on my phone so that I can accurately track my sleep patterns."
Using vivosmart HR just wish when i manually add my basketball games (not allowed to wear watch) that it could estimate steps and calories burnt with the data I input. Also doesnt sometimes sync fails if I have been using another bluetooth device,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are two user stories derived from the review, focusing on the distinct functionalities mentioned:

**User Story 1 (Basketball Game Estimation):**

""As a user who manually logs basketball games, I want the app to estimate steps and calories burned based on the game data I input, so I can get a more accurate overall activity summary even when I can't wear my Vivosmart HR.""

**User Story 2 (Bluetooth Sync Issue):**

""As a user, I want my Vivosmart HR to reliably sync with the app, even when I have been using other Bluetooth devices, so that my activity data is always up-to-date."""
Used my vivofit for over a year and app worked just fine but now since recent updates I can no longer synch my vivofit to any of my mobile devices.  If this continues I will move on to another brand of fitness tracker.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"As a user with a Vivofit fitness tracker, I want the app to reliably sync with my mobile devices after updates, so I can continue to track my fitness data without disruption and avoid switching to a different brand of fitness tracker."
Hello. Auto pause is active in the settings but unfortunately when i stop cicling the time counter didn't stop. And i have to pause manually. This is boring.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"As a cyclist, I want the app to automatically pause the time counter when I stop cycling, even when auto-pause is enabled in the settings, so that I don't have to manually pause the app and can accurately track my cycling time."
The unit does not allow changing to S.I. units (kJ instead of kcal) and has only U.S. food preprogrammed. The option to enter your own food is gone since the latest update. It is pretty useless now. And Samsung never replies to questions or suggestions.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story, keeping in mind the goal of capturing the user's needs:

**Breakdown of Issues:**

*   **Units:** User needs to use S.I. units (kJ) instead of kcal.
*   **Food Database:** User needs a food database that includes more than just U.S. foods.
*   **Custom Foods:** The option to enter custom foods has been removed and needs to be restored.
*   **Lack of Support:** The user expresses concerns about lack of support from Samsung. This is important feedback, but might not directly translate to a user story about the functionality.

**User Story Options:**

Based on the breakdown, here are a few user stories, focusing on different aspects of the review. We could choose one, or break it down into several stories:

*   **User Story 1 (Focus on Units):**  ""As a user familiar with SI units, I want to be able to switch the app to display caloric values in kJ (kilojoules) instead of kcal so that I can easily understand the nutritional information.""

*   **User Story 2 (Focus on Units & Food DB):** ""As a user outside the U.S., I want the app to support the SI units (kJ) and include a comprehensive food database with non-U.S. foods so that I can track my caloric intake accurately.""

*   **User Story 3 (Focus on Custom Foods):** ""As a user who cannot find all the foods I consume in the database, I want the ability to manually enter nutritional information for custom food items so that I can ensure my tracking is complete and accurate.""

*   **User Story 4 (Combined Units and Custom Food):** ""As a user who relies on specific units of measurement and eats diverse foods, I want the app to allow me to switch to SI units (kJ) and manually enter custom food data and nutritional information so that I can accurately track my calorie intake and make informed dietary choices.""

**Why these work:**

*   **""As a [user type]""** clearly defines who benefits.
*   **""I want [goal]""** states what the user wants to achieve.
*   **""so that [benefit]""** explains why the user wants it (the value it provides).

I would recommend the combined **User Story 4**, as it covers the most important pain points mentioned in the review. It also allows product teams to understand the overall impact of fixing these issues: greater accuracy and informed dietary choices for the user."
"This is a bad app, it doesn't count your steps correctly and it closes by itself.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's a possible user story based on that review, broken down into two separate stories for clarity:

*   **User Story 1:** ""As a user, I want the app to accurately track my steps so that I can have confidence in its data and use it to monitor my activity levels.""

*   **User Story 2:** ""As a user, I want the app to remain open and functional while in use, even in the background, so that I don't lose progress or miss tracking opportunities when the app unexpectedly closes."""
Don't like the update the graphics look more messy and the last version was  a bit more user friendly. shame as app is great .and now only shows current  year in total step count (my data) and seem to have lost total count when  using app,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories that can be derived from that review, focusing on different aspects:

**User Story 1 (Addressing the Graphic/Usability Concern):**

""As a user, I want the app to have a clear and intuitive interface, similar to the previous version, so that I can easily navigate and understand the information presented.""

**User Story 2 (Addressing the Total Step Count Issue):**

""As a user, I want to be able to view my total cumulative step count across all years, not just the current year, so that I can track my progress over time.""

**User Story 3 (More general and encompasses both issues):**

""As a user, I want the app to retain the user-friendly design and comprehensive data tracking of previous versions, so that I can continue to easily monitor my progress and enjoy using the app.""

**Explanation of why multiple User Stories:**

This is a common scenario with user reviews. They often touch on multiple issues. Breaking them down into separate user stories allows for:

*   **Prioritization:** You can prioritize the issues separately. Perhaps the data loss is more critical than the graphic change.
*   **Granularity:** Smaller stories are easier to estimate, develop, and test.
*   **Focus:** Each story addresses a specific need.

I made sure the user stories are:

*   **User-centered:** They focus on the *user* and their *needs*.
*   **Valuable:** They explain *why* the feature is important (""so that..."").
*   **Independent:** Reasonably independent of other features.
*   **Testable:** Measurable and confirmable."
Really needs a Barcode scanner for food input! Using Myfitnesspal mostly because of that,Samsung Health,feature_request,"As a user, I want to be able to scan barcodes to input food items, so that I can quickly and easily log my meals."
"WhatsApp calls on my Huawei watch GT2-C56 is shown & can be answered on iOS but not on Android. Appreciate, if this bug can be fixed on the next update in order for better experience with Android devices.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"As a user with a Huawei Watch GT2-C56 and an Android device, I want to be able to answer WhatsApp calls on my watch, the same way I can when paired with an iOS device, so that I have a consistent and improved user experience."
Waste app. Not able to login in one Plus 6t mobile. Thinking why i brought honor band.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"As a user with a OnePlus 6T mobile device, I want to be able to log into the app reliably so that I can use its features."
This is spy app. Request to access too much thing Disconnect many time and do not auto reconnect.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a couple of options, depending on how you want to prioritize the issues raised.

**Option 1 (Focus on the auto-reconnect and potential privacy concerns):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to automatically reconnect after a disconnection so that I'm not interrupted, and I want to understand why the app needs access to certain data so that I feel secure using it.""

**Option 2 (Breaking it into separate user stories for clarity):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to automatically reconnect after a disconnection so that I'm not interrupted.""
*   ""As a user, I want to understand why the app requests access to sensitive data so that I can trust its intentions and use of my information."""
I am facing problem in band whenever somebody calls it shows only incoming call instated of name of caller.,Huawei Health,feature_request,"As a user, I want the band to display the caller's name during an incoming call so that I can identify who is calling without looking at my phone."
Two step and using phone features for a health app!? No thanks.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting the review ""Two step and using phone features for a health app!? No thanks."" into a user story, depending on what we infer is the main concern:

**Option 1 (Focus on the inconvenience of two-factor authentication):**

*   ""As a user, I want to be able to access the health app without mandatory two-factor authentication if possible, so that I can quickly and easily access my health information.""

**Option 2 (Focus on the perceived privacy implications of using phone features):**

*   ""As a user, I want to understand why the health app requires phone features (like camera, location, etc.) and have assurance my data is being used responsibly, so that I can feel comfortable using the app and trust that my privacy is respected.""

**Option 3 (Broader - to capture both concerns):**

*   ""As a user, I want a simple and privacy-respecting way to access the health app, so that I can easily manage my health information without unnecessary complexity or privacy concerns.""

**Explanation of choices:**

*   **Option 1** focuses on the user's resistance to two-factor authentication. It avoids completely removing it as a requirement, allowing for the possibility of offering alternatives or explaining the security benefits.
*   **Option 2** addresses the potential worry about the app accessing phone features, emphasizing transparency and responsible data use.
*   **Option 3** is a more general user story that acknowledges both the two-step authentication and the use of phone features as potential friction points. It calls for a solution that balances convenience and privacy.

The best choice depends on the context and what problem the product team wants to address most urgently. I recommend asking the user questions to get more details for why these features are not enjoyed for the health app."
"Ever since the recent update my step count has decline by at least 10% walking the same journey. Have cleared cache and restarted phone, but same result.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"As a user, I want the step count to be accurate after app updates so that I can reliably track my daily activity and progress."
I like the app in general but the widget is annoying. I mean it's way to big for the information displayed. It was somewhat understandable when I had my note 8 with heart rate but now with S20 I should be able to resize it.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"As a user with an S20, I want to be able to resize the app's widget so that it takes up less screen space since the information displayed doesn't require such a large widget size."
Not connecting with my Poco F1 phone. It's showing that I need to update the App. But it is already updated. And why I should go to update the app from Hawaii App store. 🤷 Why there is no any update in Google Play store.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a possible user story based on the review, broken down for clarity:

*   **As a user with a Poco F1 phone, I want the app to connect properly without falsely prompting me to update from the Hawaii App store, so that I can use the app without unnecessary confusion.**

**Explanation of the Choices:**

*   **Focus on Core Problem:** The core issue is the app not connecting reliably with a specific phone model (Poco F1) and giving confusing update prompts.
*   **Specific Context:** I retained the information about the Poco F1 to maintain the context of the original review. This can help developers target their testing and debugging.
*   **Problem and Desired Outcome:** It highlights both the problem (falsely prompting an update from a specific app store) and the desired outcome (being able to use the app without issues).
*   **Removed Redundancy & Irrelevant Aspects:** The user story does not include the user's confusion about the update locations (Google Play Store vs. Hawaii App Store). This is good feedback, but addresses a different aspect of the issue.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you want me to explore any other interpretations."
Cannot sync with Google Fit. The app crashes randomly. Update the app please otherwise your watches are useless.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a conversion of the review into two user stories, addressing the separate issues mentioned:

"Data sharing needs to be fixed, my weight and activity data doesn't appear properly in Google fit. It should have more support for other activities like indoor cycling which is my case (the Huawei band has this listed as an activity, but not the app)",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of how we can convert the review into user stories:

**Analyzing the Review:**

The review actually contains two distinct user needs:

1.  **Data Synchronization with Google Fit:** The user expects the app to accurately and reliably share weight and activity data with Google Fit.
2.  **Support for More Activities (Indoor Cycling):** The user wants the app to recognize and track a wider range of activities, specifically indoor cycling.

**Turning them into User Stories:**

Here are the two user stories, broken down for clarity:

**User Story 1 (Data Synchronization):**

*   ""As a user, I want my weight and activity data to be accurately synchronized with Google Fit, so that I can have a complete view of my health and fitness data across all my platforms.""

**User Story 2 (Support for More Activities):**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to support tracking indoor cycling as an activity, so that I can accurately log my workouts and monitor my progress.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a user...""**:  Standard user story format focuses on the ""who.""
*   **""I want...""**: Expresses the user's desire.
*   **""so that...""**: Explains the benefit or reason behind the need.  This is the most critical part as it helps developers understand *why* the feature is important.
*   The stories are broken down into individual pieces as they are two seperate feature requests."

*   As a user coming from a Huawei GT2 or GT2 Pro, I want exercise tracking options comparable to what I'm accustomed to (e.g., specific exercise types) so that I don't feel limited in functionality after switching devices.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   I broke the review into separate, actionable points.
*   I used the standard user story format: ""As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit/reason].""
*   The last User Story (#4) is the most specific comparison, which might be helpful for the developers to understand *exactly* which exercise options are missing. Specifying Huawei allows the team to better understand the expectations of users accustomed to competing options in the marketplace."

When incoming call arrives on my band it displays half number instead of full number (honor band 6). Please update as soon as possible and if i turn off location band automatically got disconnected.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a breakdown of the review and a possible user story, breaking down the two issues mentioned:

**Understanding the Review:**

The review describes two distinct issues:

1.  **Incomplete Caller ID:** When a call comes in, the user's Honor Band 6 is displaying only part of the caller's number.
2.  **Disconnection on Location Off:** Turning off location services on the connected device causes the band to disconnect.

**User Stories:**

To capture these distinct problems, we create two separate user stories:

*   **User Story 1 (Incomplete Caller ID):**

    ""As a user of the Honor Band 6, I want the band to display complete caller ID information for incoming calls so that I can identify who is calling me without needing to check my phone.""

*   **User Story 2 (Disconnection on Location Off):**

    ""As a user of the Honor Band 6, I want the band to remain connected to my device even when location services are turned off, so that I can still receive notifications and use other band features without sacrificing my privacy or battery.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Clarity:** User stories are written to be clear and easily understood by everyone on the development team.
*   **""As a..."" ""I want..."" ""So that...""**: This template is common and guides the creation of effective user stories.
*   **Focus on Benefit:** User stories emphasize the *benefit* to the user.  Why does the user want this functionality?  How will their experience be improved?
*   **Separate Issues:** It's generally best to break down complex reviews into individual user stories, each addressing a single issue. This makes it easier to prioritize, estimate, and track the resolution of each problem."
You got rid of the one measurement I used. I have severe asthma and used the oxygen measurements for my doctor and myself. The stress one takes much longer and doesn't track it...,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options, depending on the focus you want to take:

**Option 1 (Focus on restoring the feature):**

""As a user with asthma, I want the oxygen measurement feature to be restored so I can easily track my oxygen levels for personal health monitoring and to share with my doctor.""

**Option 2 (Focus on replacing the lost functionality):**

""As a user with asthma, I want an alternative to the previous oxygen measurement feature that is quick and accurately tracks my oxygen levels for personal health monitoring and to share with my doctor.""

**Option 3 (More granular, addressing both issues):**

*   ""As a user with asthma, I want the oxygen measurement feature restored so that I can track my oxygen levels.""
*   ""As a user, I want the stress measurement feature to be faster and more effective at tracking stress levels.""

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Option 1** is the most direct response to the review, assuming the goal is to simply reinstate the removed feature.
*   **Option 2** allows room for an alternative solution if simply restoring it is not feasible. It emphasizes the core need – measuring oxygen.
*   **Option 3** breaks down the review into to two separate user stories. This might be helpful if the stress feature and oxygen feature are separate or if the team prioritizes them differently.

Choose the option that best fits the context of the project and the development team's strategy. I Lean towards Option 1 or Option 3 as the strongest choices."
"Always shows as running in the background since latest update, please fix! even after latest update says it is using battery",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a couple of options for user stories based on the review, focusing on different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on accurate background status):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to accurately reflect whether it's running in the background so I'm not unnecessarily worried about battery drain.**

**Option 2 (Focus on battery consumption):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to minimize battery usage when running in the background so my device's battery life isn't significantly impacted.**

**Option 3 (More specific and combining elements):**

*   **As a user, I want the app to stop consuming battery in the background after I've closed it, so I can be confident it isn't draining my battery unnecessarily even after the latest update.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Option 1** focuses on the incorrect indicator. It assumes the root problem is the app *saying* it's running when it isn't (and potentially isn't actually using battery).
*   **Option 2** is more direct to what the user is concerned about (battery drain). It avoids assuming the reported background activity is the *cause* of the drain. The app might have a bug causing battery usage without accurately reporting it.
*   **Option 3** attempts to combine both the incorrect running state and battery consumption into one story for a more comprehensive approach.

Which option is *best* depends on what problem you, as the developer, want to prioritize and how you interpret the underlying issue based on more thorough diagnostics. If you suspect the incorrect running indicator is a simple display error, Option 1 is good. If you suspect a bigger issue is battery drain caused by *something* happening in the background, Option 2 or 3 is preferable."
"Excellent for cycling, wizh it had greater flexibility in logging strength workouts, unable to write in different exercises",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here's a user story derived from the review ""Excellent for cycling, wizh it had greater flexibility in logging strength workouts, unable to write in different exercises"":

**As a user who enjoys cycling and strength training, I want the ability to log a wider variety of strength exercises with custom names so that I can accurately track my full workout routine within the app.**"
"Bluetooth connection getting lost, not loading with recent update. No login was required earlier, now it's asking for that, don't understand the logic.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories we could develop from that review, depending on the focus:

**Focusing on the lost Bluetooth connection:**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to maintain a stable Bluetooth connection so that I can rely on it to function correctly.""

**Focusing on the unexpected login requirement:**

*   ""As a user, I want the app to function as it did before the update, without requiring a login, if that's appropriate for the app's functionality.""

**Focusing on a combined issue:**

*   ""As a user, I am frustrated that the recent update has introduced a login requirement *and* made the Bluetooth connection unreliable; I want both of these issues resolved so I can use the app as intended."""
"Pretty good app. Keeps me honest. Could always use more food/ nutrition counts, exercises and would like to see it get a bit smarter. Lots of repetitive messages.",Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories we can extract from that review, breaking it down for clarity:

**User Story 1 (Food/Nutrition Data):** ""As a user, I want the app to have a more comprehensive database of food and nutrition information, so that I can accurately track my dietary intake.""

**User Story 2 (Exercise Database):** ""As a user, I want the app to include a wider variety of exercises, so that I have more options for logging my physical activity.""

**User Story 3 (Intelligent Features - Vague, needs clarification):** ""As a user, I want the app to learn my preferences and provide more personalized guidance [or suggestions], so that it feels more intelligent and helpful."" (Note: Needs more detail on ""smarter"" - specific examples would be beneficial)

**User Story 4 (Reduce Repetitive Messages):** ""As a user, I want to receive fewer repetitive messages from the app, so that the experience feels less annoying and more relevant.""

**Explanation of why I made these choices:**

*   **Breaking it down:** The review covers a few different areas for improvement. It's best to split it into individual user stories to make them actionable.
*   **Focus on the ""why"":** I expanded on the user's implicit needs.  For example, they want more food data *so that* they can accurately track intake.  They want fewer messages *so that* the experience is less annoying.
*   **The ""smart"" part needs more detail:** The ""get a bit smarter"" comment is very vague.  I indicated this by saying the user story needs more clarification. In a real development scenario, you'd want to ask the user *what* they mean by ""smarter"" with some examples of what they want."
I do love this app. Would be better if Fitbit was a partner app as i feel  that would track my steps better as my phone isnt on me contantly,Samsung Health,feature_request,"As a user, I want the app to integrate with Fitbit so that my steps are tracked more accurately, even when my phone isn't on me."
Update ruined everything. My data is lost. Rubbish syncing and never updates my steps anymore. Disconnects every few minutes and counts nap when I'm awake. I thought it's firmware issue but turns it it's just this garbage app.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's a possible breakdown of the review into several user stories:

*   **As a user, I want the app to reliably sync my data so that I don't lose progress data after updates.** (Addresses ""My data is lost"" and ""Rubbish syncing"")
*   **As a user, I want the app to accurately track my steps so that I can monitor my activity levels correctly.** (Addresses ""never updates my steps anymore"")
*   **As a user, I want the app to maintain a stable connection to my device so that I can consistently track my activity.** (Addresses ""Disconnects every few minutes"")
*   **As a user, I want the app to accurately distinguish between napping and being awake so that my sleep and activity data is correct.** (Addresses ""counts nap when I'm awake"")"
step count is not correct but it was never a issue for me if it is 2 - 4% but in running its sarting with 10 to 15 % less secount while running scren geting off as normal app which is irritating.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a couple of options for converting the review into user stories, depending on how granular you want to be:

**Option 1 (Splitting into two stories for clarity):**

*   **User Story 1: As a runner, I want the app to accurately track my step count during runs, so I can monitor my performance correctly.** (This addresses the 10-15% difference mentioned in the review)

*   **User Story 2: As a user, I want the running screen to remain active while I am running, so I can continuously view my metrics without interruption.** (This addresses the screen turning off issue)

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Specificity:** I broke the review into two distinct problems: inaccurate step counting and the screen turning off. Separating them into two user stories allows developers to address them individually.
*   **Focus on Value:** Each user story focuses on the *value* to the user. They want accurate metrics and an uninterrupted experience.
*   **""As a...I want...So that..."" Format:** This is the standard format for user stories. Defining 'who', 'what', and 'why'."
I work a 12 hr shift and i walk 10 of those hours.  This doesn't count all of my steps. Not happy about the way it shows your rewards. Won't let you see each reward. Before update was better. Not excited about using this anymore.,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories we can extract from that review, prioritizing the most critical issues first:

*   **As a user who works long shifts and walks a lot, I want the step counter to accurately track all my steps, even during extended periods of activity, so that I can get a true representation of my daily activity level.** (Addresses the core problem of inaccurate step counting)

*   **As a user, I want to be able to see the details of each reward I've earned so that I know what I have to redeem.** (Addresses the limited reward information)

You *could* also add this user story to capture the general feedback about the update:

*   **As a user, I want recent updates to be thoroughly tested and validated based on user feedback so the overall usability is improved and not hindered** (Captures the general sentiment of the update worsening the experience)."
"Did not want this. Cannot delete it. Cannot even turn out off. Google, block this app!",Samsung Health,problem_report,"As a user, I want to be able to uninstall or disable this app so that I have control over the software on my device."
"This was a great app however no update in recent times, need auto pause feature Most of the apps support auto pause n start feature, will appreciate more sporty interface.",Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's a breakdown of the review and corresponding user stories:

**Breakdown of the Review:**

*   **""no update in recent times""**: This implies a desire for ongoing maintenance and improvement.  It's not directly a user story, but rather feedback for the development team.
*   **""need auto pause feature""**: This is a clear feature request.
*   **""Most of the apps support auto pause n start feature""**:  This reinforces the need for the auto-pause feature by referencing a common industry standard/expectation.
*   **""will appreciate more sporty interface""**: This is a request for visual/aesthetic improvements.

**User Stories:**

Here are two user stories derived from the review:

1. **As a user who exercises, I want the app to automatically pause when I stop moving so that I don't have to manually pause/resume my activity tracking.** (Addresses the ""auto pause"" feature)

2. **As a user, I want a more modern and visually appealing interface so that the app feels more dynamic and engaging during my workouts.** (Adresses the ""More Spory Interface"" request)"
After the last update I cannot pair my weight scale with the app. It stops at a message like :Huawei Health wants to access servers in Mainland to download files... Etc. Even if I press allow its not working and the message appears again and again.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"""As a user, I want to be able to successfully pair my weight scale with the app after the update, so that I can track my weight data without encountering recurring permission requests and connection failures."""
"It's great now. Love. Just wish you could pause the run instead of stopping it, or is there a way to pause without stopping it?",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"As a user, I want the ability to pause a run so that I can temporarily stop and resume my run without ending the activity."
App can't connect to the watch. Since the last update it is even worse.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"As a user, I want the app to reliably connect to my watch so that I can use all of its features without connection issues."
"Works great with z5 and my forerunner 230. No issues with connection between the two at all. Sometimes sleep tracking can be a little inaccurate but not by much. There has never been a problem syncing with strava, can't comment on mapmyfitness unfortunately as I don't use it yet.",Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here's a user story derived from the review, prioritizing the positive aspects and acknowledging the minor sleep tracking issue:

**As a user, I want the app to reliably connect and sync data with my Garmin Forerunner 230 and Strava so that I can easily track my fitness activities.**"
Since the latest update my device won't connect with my phone,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"As a user, I want the app to connect to my device after an update, so that I can continue to use its features without connection issues."
Update: new update fixed it Old: Your update just made Health device useless,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a couple of approaches, depending on what you want to emphasize in the user story.  Since the review mentions a fix, we can focus on the problem *before* the fix, or the desire to keep the fix working.

**Option 1 (Focus on the initial problem):**

*   **As a user, I want updates to maintain the existing functionality of my health devices so that I can continue using them as expected.**

**Option 2 (Focus on safeguarding against future issues):**

*   **As a user, I want to ensure that future updates will not break compatibility with my health devices, so I can continue to rely on them for health tracking.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   **Option 1** directly addresses the original complaint; that an update *broke* the functionality. It's broader than just the single update, however, and aims to avoid future breakage.
*   **Option 2** focuses on maintaining that functionality *going forward*. This might be useful if you are happy with the current state (after the fix) and want regression tests to prevent future problems.

Which option is best depends on your specific needs and what you want to emphasize."
