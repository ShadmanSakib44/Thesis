I am happy with the app but Don't buy huawei band 4 because it is not beetter then mi band 4 huawei band should get more improve in updated not even amoled or not our own wallpaper,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here's the user review converted into a user story, broken down to capture the key elements:

**User Story Title:** Dissatisfied with Huawei Band 4 Features Compared to Mi Band 4

**As a user of the [App Name] app who is considering fitness trackers,**

**I want to be able to use the [App Name] app with a fitness tracker that offers a range of features and customization options comparable to the Mi Band 4,**

**So that I can have a satisfying and personalized experience tracking my fitness and well-being.**

**Details:**

*   **Specific Issue:** The Huawei Band 4 currently lacks features and overall quality compared to the Mi Band 4.
*   **Desired Improvement:** Huawei Band 4 needs improvements in updates, including considering features not even as advanced as an AMOLED display and custom watch face functionality (our own wallpaper.)

**Acceptance Criteria (Implied):**

*   The [App Name] app should function seamlessly with fitness trackers that offer a similar or better feature set as the Mi Band 4.
*   Compatible fitness trackers linked to [app name] support custom watch faces, AMOLED display, and should have frequent upgrades and functionality implementations.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Focus on the App's Role:**  The user story emphasizes the app's perspective.  While the user is generally dissatisfied with the Huawei Band 4, the story frames it in terms of what the user *expects* from devices used with the application.
*   **Generalization for Future:** Instead of directly saying ""The app should make the Huawei Band 4 better,"" the user story focuses on the broader need for compatibility with feature-rich fitness trackers.  This leaves room for the app developers to improve compatibility with many devices, not just the Huawei Band 4.
*   **Emphasis on comparison:** User specifically mentions that the key issue they're experiencing is based on comparison, they're expecting some features to be available in the band (updates, AMOLED displays etc.). Added it in details session of user story."
"After the last two updates, the app stopp taking record of my sleep time automatically.... I kindly advice the developers to see to that...",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here are a few versions of a user story based on the user review, each with a slightly different focus:

**Version 1 (Focus on core need):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to automatically track my sleep time, **so that** I don't have to manually enter my sleep data and can accurately monitor my sleep patterns.

**Version 2 (Focus on the problem caused by the updates):**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to continue automatically tracking my sleep time as it did before the last two updates, **so that** my sleep records are consistently and accurately logged.

**Version 3 (More Specific/Detailed):**

*   **As a user who relies on automatic sleep tracking,** I am frustrated that the app no longer automatically records my sleep time after the recent updates, **so that** I can continue to effortlessly monitor my sleep data and identify any potential sleep issues.

**Key takeaways in creating user stories from reviews:**

*   **""As a user"" or similar:**  Start with identifying the role of the user.
*   **""I want"" or similar:** Clearly state the user's desire or need.
*   **""So that"" or similar:** Explain the user's motivation and the benefit they receive."
"I bought this thinking i could use this for open water swimming. Far from efficient, as i couldnt close the app after i finished. Would have been great to have been able to tell the actual water temp too. Also the sleep function is ineffective.",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories based on the provided review, broken down for clarity:

**Focusing on the Inability to Close the App:**

*   **As an open water swimmer, I want to be able to easily close the app after I finish my swim, so that I don't waste battery life and can move on to other things.**

**Focusing on the Lack of Water Temperature:**

*   **As an open water swimmer, I want the app to display the actual water temperature, so that I can accurately track my swim conditions and understand its impact on my body.**

**Focusing on the Ineffective Sleep Function:**

*   **As a user, I want the sleep function to accurately track my sleep patterns, so that I can better understand my rest and improve my overall well-being.**

**A More Comprehensive Story encompassing all points:**

*   **As an open water swimmer who also uses the app for general health tracking, I want the app to accurately track my swim data (including water temperature), allow me to easily close the app when finished, and provide a reliable sleep tracking function, so that I can get a complete and accurate picture of my activity and health.**

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **Focus on the user:** They all start with ""As a...""
*   **State the need:** They explain *what* the user wants.
*   **Explain the benefit:** They explain *why* the user wants it.
*   **Are understandable:** They use clear and simple language.
*   **Are testable:** They provide criteria that can be used to determine if the story is complete. For example, for the water temperature story, a testable criteria would be ""The app displays a water temperature reading."""

**As a fitness tracker user who sometimes uses devices other than my phone to track my steps, I want to be able to manually input my step data into the app so that I can have a complete record of my activity and accurately track my progress.**"

Overall quite a good app but needs to be a little easier to access the settings section...,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting that review into a user story, depending on the level of detail you want:

**Option 1 (Focus on the Goal):**

*   **As a user,** I want to easily access the settings section of the app, **so that** I can quickly adjust configurations and personalize my experience.

**Option 2 (Adding the ""Why""):**

**Option 3 (More Specific - implying how ease of access can be gauged):**

*   **As a user,** I want to reach the settings section with fewer taps or clicks, **so that** I can quickly modify my preferences and spend more time using the app's core features.

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **User-centric:**  They start with ""As a user...""
*   **Goal-oriented:** They clearly state what the user wants to achieve.
*   **Value-driven:** They explain why the user wants this.
*   **Concise:** They capture the essence of the review in a brief statement.

Disappointed with this app. No way to install additional watch faces unless you download the moded chinese version. Why is this app not regularly updated?,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here are a few user stories based on the user review, focusing on different aspects of the feedback:

**Option 1 (Focus on missing watch faces):**

*   **As a user of the watch face app,**
*   **I want to be able to install new watch faces directly through the app,**
*   **So that I don't have to resort to downloading potentially unsafe and modified versions from external sources.**

**Option 2 (Focus on ease of finding new watch faces):**

*   **As a user of the app,**
*   **I want the app to have a large selection of watch faces already in the app that can be applied without modification,**
*   **So that I can quickly and safely find a watch face I like to use.**

**Option 3 (Focus on updates and maintenance):**

*   **As a user of the app,**
*   **I want the app to be regularly updated with new features, security patches, or watch faces,**
*   **So that I can be reassured that the app is actively supported and a quality product.**

**Option 4 (Combining concerns):**

*   **As a user,**
*   **I want a regularly updated app with an easy and legitimate way to download and install new watch faces,**
*   **So that I can customize my watch without compromising its security or functionality.**

**Explanation of how these stories address the original feedback:**

*   **""No way to install additional watch faces unless you download the moded chinese version"":** This translates into the user's desire for a legitimate and easy way to install watch faces *within* the app, removing the need for external sources. The ""moded chinese version"" implies a safety concern and lack of official support.

*   **""Why is this app not regularly updated?"":** This becomes the user's need for regular updates, implying they want bug fixes, new features, and confidence that the application is being maintained.

The best option depends on which aspect you want to emphasize. In general, a single, focused user story is often preferable to a very broad one. If you are addressing the user's concerns in a single, high-level story, be sure to break out the tasks into separate implementation stories to reflect the distinct user's desired functionality."

It dosent even count my steps sometime.. really frustrating, also weight management feature is no longer there with the new update.. pointless having this app anymore..",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the user review converted into a user story:

**As a health-conscious user, I am frustrated that the app no longer accurately tracks my steps and the weight management feature has been removed, so I feel the app is now pointless for my health tracking goals and I'm looking for a replacement.**

**Explanation of how it aligns with a user story format:**

*   **As a...** identifies the user persona: ""health-conscious user"" (derived from tracking steps and weight).
*   **I want...** (implied) - I want the app to reliably track my steps and provide features to manage my weight. This is based on the users statement of what issues that have impacted their workflow.
*   **So that...** identifies the benefit/reason: ""I feel the app is now pointless for my health tracking goals and I'm looking for a replacement."" (This explains why the user is frustrated and considering abandoning the app.)

This user story captures the core issues the user is experiencing and why they are dissatisfied with the app. It frames the problem from their perspective and highlights the impact on their overall goal of managing their health."
Does the job. But my floor count is so inaccurate the last 4 weeks. Vivosmart keeps saying I've climed 35+ floors everyday when its more like 10-15 floor.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here are a few options for user stories based on that user review, ranging in specificity:

**Option 1 (Focus on the general problem):**

*   **As a user, I want my Vivosmart to accurately track the number of floors I climb, so that I can have a reliable measure of my daily activity.**

**Option 2 (More specific, including the inaccurate tracking):**

*   **As a Vivosmart user, I am frustrated that my floor climb count has become increasingly inaccurate in the last 4 weeks, reporting over 35 floors per day when I am actually climbing between 10-15 floors, leading to a distorted view of my fitness progress.**

**Option 3 (Most specific, including the frequency and a rough timeframe):**

*   **As a Vivosmart user, I want the floor climb count to be accurate, but for the past 4 weeks, my Vivosmart is reporting significantly inflated numbers (35+ floors) when I realistically climb only 10-15 floors daily.**

**Which option is best depends on the level of detail needed for your development process.** Option 1 is a good starting point. If you want to give more context right away, then Option 2 or 3 are more suitable."

**Why these work:**

*   They are all written from the user's point of view.
*   They clearly state the desired functionality.
*   They provide the ""so that"" clause to explain the benefit or value to the user.

You can choose the user story (or stories) that best addresses the specific issue you want to resolve. I would recommend creating separate tickets for these items, based on what area of the app they impact."

*   **As a user, I want to be able to connect my watch to my phone after the update, so that I can continue to use the features I rely on.**

**Option 2 (Focus on the gender setting issue):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to set my gender in the app, so that my profile information is accurate and personalized.**

**Option 3 (Combines both issues):**

*   **As a user, after an update, I want to be able to connect my watch to my phone and set my gender, so that I can continue using the app as intended and have an accurate profile.**

**Option 4 (Focus on the impact of the update):**

*   **As a user, I am frustrated that the recent update has broken the connection between my watch and phone, and prevents me from setting my gender, so I want these issues resolved quickly to restore the functionality I had before the update.**

The best option depends on which issue is considered more critical or which aspect the development team wants to prioritize."
"Sleep stats are way to conservative since some time (nearly always they require an edit to add sleep time). Also, the app does not want to sync watch data without internet connection - why? What about trying to sync in a remote location out of range?",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories we can derive from that review, focusing on different aspects the user raised:

**User Story 1 (Focus: Sleep Stats Accuracy)**

*   **As a user,** I want the sleep tracking feature to accurately detect when I fall asleep and wake up, **so that** I don’t have to manually edit my sleep data and the recorded statistics are representative of my actual sleep patterns.

**User Story 2 (Focus: Offline Syncing)**

*   **As a user,** I want my watch data to sync with the app even when I don't have an internet connection, **so that** I can track my progress and view my data even in remote areas or situations without internet access.

**User Story 3 (Focus: Remote Location Syncing)**

*   **As a user,** I want the app to attempt to sync my watch data even when I am in a remote location with a poor or absent internet connection, **so that** my training data is not lost and uploads eventually when I regain connectivity.

**Explanation of the Choices:**

*   Each story follows the standard ""As a [user type], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"" format.
*   We break down the review into specific concerns. One user may have multiple needs.
*   The stories use the user's language and reflect their perspective (e.g., ""I want,"" ""remote location,"" ""don't have to manually edit"").
*   The ""so that"" portion provides the *reason* behind the user's desire, which is crucial for developers to understand the underlying need."

**As a user who enjoys cycling, I want the app to track my cycling activity (similar to how it tracks walking and running), so that I can monitor my fitness progress and have a complete record of my physical activity.**"
"My only complaint is if the watch gets powered off (often due to freezing while charging), the app won't sync correctly when the watch is turned back on. It just keeps the info from before the watch was powered off.",Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story based on the review, from the user's perspective:

**As a user, I want the app to automatically and accurately sync with my watch after it's been powered off (regardless of the reason), so that my data is up-to-date and I don't lose information.**

**Breakdown of why this works:**

*   **""As a..."":** This identifies the user role.
*   **""I want..."":** This defines the user's desire or goal.
*   **""So that..."":** This states the benefit or reason behind the desire.

**Key Considerations and Possible Improvements:**

*   **Specificity:** The original review lacks specifics about which app the user is trying to sync. ideally you could ask, ""which app are you using?"" to improve the story.
*   **Uncertainty of Root causes:** The user is asking if there are secondary settings that prevent functionality. You may want to have an acceptance criteria around confirming that the linking process (assuming account is already linked) to the app to myfitnesspal is functioning correctly/efficiently."

Updated today and now shows my weight as 10.5:7.0 st?! What the hell is that all about!,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few user story options, depending on how you want to emphasize different aspects of the issue:

**Option 1 (Focus on Correctness):**

> As a user, I want my weight to be displayed in a clear and understandable format (e.g., 10.5 st) after an app update, so I can accurately track my weight progress.

**Option 2 (Focus on Functionality Being Broken):**

> As a user, I want the weight display functionality to work correctly after an app update, so I'm not confused by nonsensical values like ""10.5:7.0 st"".

**Option 3 (Focus on the Impact of the Bug):**

> As a user, I need the weight displayed in the app to be accurate and meaningful, so I can trust the app to provide reliable progress tracking and make informed decisions about my health and fitness goals.  Seeing an incorrect format (""10.5:7.0 st"") erodes my trust in the app.

* **""...I want..."" or ""...I need...""**:  This expresses the user's desired outcome or requirement.
* **""...so that...""**: This provides the reasoning or benefit for the user.

The best option will depend on the overall context of your project and which aspect of the issue you want to highlight.  I personally lean towards Option 2 as it best captures the fact that a previously working function is now broken."

Sleep track doesn't work. The app doesn't have the same features as the watch. Ridiculous.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user stories that could be created from that review, ranging from very basic to more specific:

**1. Basic User Story:**

*   **As a user, I want the sleep tracking feature to work as expected, so that I can accurately monitor my sleep patterns.**

**2.  More Specific User Story (Focusing on Functionality):**

*   **As a user, I want the sleep tracking feature to accurately record my sleep data and provide meaningful insights, so that I can understand my sleep habits and improve my sleep quality.**

**3. User Story Highlighting Feature Parity:**

*   **As a user, I want the mobile app to have the same features and functionality as the watch, so that I have a consistent and complete user experience regardless of the device I use.**

**4. Combining Both Concerns**

*   **As a user, I want the sleep tracking feature on the mobile app to function as accurately and reliably as it does on the watch, so that I can trust the data and improve my sleep patterns, regardless of the device I'm using to view the information.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   The original review expresses two main pain points: the sleep tracking doesn't work, and the app features are inconsistent with the watch.
*   I've created user stories that address both of these points individually.
*   The ""basic"" user story is very general and focuses on the core problem.
*   The more specific user stories add more detail about the desired outcome and motivation.
*   The ""Combining Both Concerns"" story directly addresses both user frustrations in one concise user story.

The best user story will depend on the specific development context and the level of detail needed. I hope it helps!"

It's great when it's working. It keeps losing sync and I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again. It's happening more and more 😒,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story, breaking down the review into its essential elements:

**As a user, I want the application to maintain sync consistently so that I don't have to uninstall and reinstall it frequently.**

**Breaking it down:**

*   **As a user:**  This clearly identifies the user of the system.
*   **I want the application to maintain sync consistently:** This addresses the core problem: the application loses sync. The user wants this problem fixed.
*   **so that I don't have to uninstall and reinstall it frequently:** This explains why the user wants the sync to be a more reliable process.  It directly connects the desired outcome (stable sync) to the user's pain point (having to reinstall frequently).

**Optional Additions (for more context):**

You could potentially add:

*   **(And I am frustrated when this happens more and more)** *or*  **(because it's happening more and more often)** - captures the sentiment. It justifies why the original problem of syncing needs to be addressed even though it is already working.

This addition adds a touch of emotion from the review that will help the developers focus on the issue. The point behind adding this is to provide the developers with a better understanding of the original user's problem."

"How does it calculate calories? Walked 40 min with 4km/h speed. It is about 2.7km. And the app says me I burnt about 350 calories. How this even possible? In reality it would be 110-130 calories. Please, fix. Otherwise it is useless.",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story derived from the review:

**As a health-conscious user tracking my calorie burn during walks, I want the app to accurately calculate the calories I've burned based on my activity data (duration, distance, and speed) so that I can rely on the calorie information to manage my weight and fitness.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   When I walk for 40 minutes at a speed of 4 km/h (resulting in approximately 2.7 km distance), the app should calculate a calorie burn within a reasonable range (e.g., 110-130 calories seems appropriate based on the user's feedback).
*   The app's calculated calorie burn should be significantly more accurate than the current inflated estimate (350 calories in the example provided).
*   The calorie calculation method should take into account factors such as distance, speed (which can infer intensity), and potentially user-specific data (e.g., weight, age, gender).

**What this story captures:**

*   **Who:** A health-conscious user.
*   **What:** Accurate calorie calculation during walking.
*   **Why:** To manage weight and fitness based on reliable information.
*   **Problem:** Current calorie calculation is wildly inaccurate, making the app ""useless"" for this user."

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   I can see a clearly visible and functional calorie intake meter.
*   I can see a clearly visible and functional calorie outtake meter.
*   The calorie tracking feature should be intuitive and easy to use.
*   Ideally, the feature should be available in all future versions of the app."
Good app. But it would be nice if I can choose my own totals in Actvities > Cycling > Totals... etc. Total climb instead of calories or distance. Thank you.,Garmin Connect,feature_request,"Here's the user story based on the user review:

**As a cyclist using the Activities feature, I want to be able to customize which total metric is displayed on the cycling summary screen (e.g., total climb), so I can easily track the information that is most relevant to my cycling progress.**

**Alternatively (broken down into smaller stories):**

*   **As a cyclist using the Activities feature, I want to be able to choose from a list of available metrics (e.g., distance, calories, total climb) to display on the cycling totals screen.**
*   **As a cyclist using the Activities feature, I want total climb to be an available metric to display on the cycling totals screen.**

**Elements Broken Down:**

*   **As a:** Specifies the user role (cyclist using the Activities feature).
*   **I want to:** Describes the desired functionality (personalize totals).

*   **As a user, I want to understand why the application needs access to my call logs, so that I can be confident that my privacy is respected and I'm not being tracked unnecessarily.** (This highlights the user's privacy concerns and desire for transparency.)

**Option 3 (Focus on Trust and Credibility):**

*   **As a user, I want to trust that the application is not accessing data unnecessarily and violating my privacy, so that I can feel safe and comfortable using the application.** (This aims to fix the trust breach.)

**Option 4 (Combining both issues):**

*   **As a user, I want to**
    *   **be able to export my data from the application**
    *   **understand why the application needs access to my call logs**
    **so that I can use the application effectively and with confidence in its privacy practices.**

**Explanation of why user stories are important from a Customer/Business perspective**

I am using huawei gt 2 This app has sooo disappointing watch faces.without any custom for faces.And it looks so poor and not in 3d model at all.samsung has more features and more customs for their watches and i have a bit of shame on you huawei,Huawei Health,feature_request,"Here's the user review converted into a user story:

**As a Huawei GT 2 user, I want more visually appealing and customizable watch faces, so that I can personalize my watch and feel proud of its appearance.**

**Breakdown & Explanation:**

*   **As a Huawei GT 2 user:** This clearly identifies the user's role and the context (owning a Huawei GT 2).
*   **I want more visually appealing and customizable watch faces:** This states the user's need or desire. ""Visually appealing"" addresses the ""poor"" and ""not 3D model"" aspect. ""Customizable"" addresses the complaint about the lack of custom options.
*   **so that I can personalize my watch and feel proud of its appearance:**  This states the user's motivation and the positive outcome they hope to achieve. It addresses the ""shame on you Huawei"" sentiment – implying the user wants to feel better about their Huawei watch compared to the perceived advantages of Samsung watches. It also points to a desire for personalization.

This User Story is clear, concise, and understandable for developers. It explains *who* wants *what* and *why*. It also captures the underlying frustration and desire for a better user experience as expressed in the original review."
3 messages in 4 hours now getting very annoying.stop it,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here's the conversion of the user review ""3 messages in 4 hours now getting very annoying. stop it"" into a user story from the user's perspective:

**As a user, I want to receive notifications at a reasonable frequency so that I am not annoyed by too many messages in a short period of time.**

**Alternatively, a more specific version focusing on the timing:**

**As a user, I want to receive fewer notifications per hour so that I don't feel overwhelmed with messages.**

**Breakdown of why this works:**

*   **""As a user""**: Identifies the actor, the person experiencing the problem.
*   **""I want to...""**: Expresses the desire of the user, the goal they're trying to achieve.
*   **""..receive notifications at a reasonable frequency...""**: Addresses the core issue of too many notifications in a short time. The use of ""reasonable frequency"" acknowledges that the exact acceptable rate might need further definition (and potentially user configuration).
*   **""...so that I am not annoyed by too many messages in a short period of time.""**: Provides the reason/benefit for the user's desire.  This explains the negative impact they are trying to avoid.

**Why this is better than simply saying ""As a user, I want fewer notifications"":**

*   It focuses on the core problem – the *annoyance* caused by the frequency. It leaves room for solutions that might not simply involve reducing the total number of notifications, but perhaps grouping them, delaying them, or making them more meaningful/relevant.
*   It leads to better thinking about *why* the user is annoyed and promotes solutions besides just blindly reducing the number of notifications. The solution may implement notification settings where the user can set daily/hourly limits to their liking."
Why does it not work on the Xiaomi MI4 phone? Seems strange that on a new phone it would not work. Does the phone software just need to be updated??,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here's the user story converted from the review:

**As a Xiaomi MI4 phone user,**
**I want to be able to use this app on my phone,**
**So that I can access its features and benefits like other users do.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The app works as expected on a Xiaomi MI4 phone.
*   If a software update is required for the phone, the app clearly communicates this to the user and provides instructions on how to update.
*   The app functions correctly after the required software update.

**Additional Considerations (Based on the review):**

*   Investigate why the app isn't working on the Xiaomi MI4.
*   Determine if a software update is the root cause.
*   If an update is needed, provide clear and easy-to-follow instructions within the app.

This user story captures the user's need in a concise and actionable format, ready for development teams to understand and address. It also highlights the importance of compatibility across different devices and the need for clear communication with users regarding necessary updates."
"It's good but the Bluetooth connection with the band keeps falling and you have to go to the app to reconnect , and the band itself counts steps if you just move it in your hand !!",Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user stories based on the user's review, prioritizing different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on Bluetooth):**

*   **As a user, I want a reliable and stable Bluetooth connection between my band and the app so that I don't have to manually reconnect every time the connection drops.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Step Counting Accuracy):**

*   **As a user, I want the step counter on my band to accurately reflect steps taken while walking or running, and not register steps from general hand movements.**

**Option 3 (More Granular, addressing both issues):**

*   **As a user, I want the Bluetooth connection between my band and the app to remain stable and consistent so that my data is always synced and I don't lose information.**
*   **As a user, I want the step counter to only count steps when I am actually walking or running, so that I can get an accurate measurement of my daily activity.**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   **Option 1:** This is a good general story if the Bluetooth issue is the user's biggest pain point.
*   **Option 2:**  This is a good general story if the inaccurate step counting is the biggest issue.
*   **Option 3:** This breaks the review into two separate user stories, addressing each problem individually. This is often best because you can prioritize and address each issue separately.  It also provides more clarity for the development team.

The best option will depend on how granular you want to be and which aspect of the review you want to emphasize. All the options capture the user's intent from their perspective."

Without pairing step count continuously. Ultimately very high count different in watch and applications.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here's the user story converted from the user review:

**As a health-conscious user, I want my watch to accurately track my step count consistently and report the same count in the watch and application, so that I can reliably monitor my activity level and fitness progress.**

**Explanation of the Conversion:**

*   **""As a health-conscious user""**:  This assumes some motivation behind the user's desire for accurate step tracking.  Perhaps they are working towards fitness goals or monitoring their general health.
*   **""I want..."":**  This is the statement of need - what feature or functionality the user desires.
*   **""So that..."":**  This explained the value to the user - why they want the feature. Why is continuously consistent accurate tracking and reporting in multiple places important to them? For fitness progress."

**As a user, I want my Garmin application to only interact with files it's intended to interact with, so I can be confident it's not accessing unrelated data and potentially causing security issues on my device.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Focus on the User:** The story is written from the ""I"" perspective of the user.

*   **Problem-Oriented:** The core problem is that the application is behaving unexpectedly, trying to open files unrelated to its core function.

*   **Value/Benefit:** The goal is to give the user confidence in the application's behavior and ensure it is not behaving in a suspicious or ""virus-like"" manner."

I am unable to sync this with my galaxy 3,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories based on the review ""I am unable to sync this with my galaxy 3"", with variations in specificity and potential user intentions:

**Option 1 (Most Basic):**

*   **As a user with a Galaxy S3, I want to be able to sync my device with this application/service, so that I can access and manage my data across both platforms.**

**Option 2 (Slightly More Specific, Assuming Data Access/Management is the Goal):**

*   **As a user with a Samsung Galaxy S3, I want to be able to sync my data (e.g., contacts, calendar, photos) with this application, so that my information is consistent and accessible on both my phone and the application/service.**

**Option 3 (Focus on Potential Frustration):**

*   **As a user with a Samsung Galaxy S3, I am frustrated that I can't sync my device with this application, and I want a solution to allow me to seamlessly connect and transfer data between my phone and the application.**

**Option 4 (Emphasis on compatibility):**

*   **As a user, I need this application to be compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S3, so that I can sync my device and utilize all of the application's features.**

**Key Considerations:**

*   **The ""this""**:  In each story, ""this application/service"" refers to whatever product the user is reviewing.  *You* need to replace ""this application/service"" with the name of the actual application or service.
*   **User's Intent:**  The hardest part is guessing *why* the user wants to sync. Options 1 and 2 assume it's about access and management. If the user mentioned any specific type of data (e.g., contacts, photos, music) in a longer review, *incorporate that*.
*   **The Galaxy S3:**  Important to retain that information since the user is explicitly stating it. Perhaps it's the device causing the problem.
*   **The context:** This is the biggest factor. You may be missing important information. If you had a longer review, you could fill in what data is important for the user to sync.

Choose the user story that best reflects the user's likely intention based on the available information and then tailor it with any additional facts."

Not good at all. My monthly report for April shows the same stats which were there for March month. Recommended courses also does not work properly.,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few variations of the user story, capturing slightly different nuances of the user's complaint:

**Option 1 (Focus on the core problem):**

> As a user, I want my monthly report to reflect the current month's data, so that I can accurately track my progress and performance.  Currently, my monthly reports are showing duplicated data from the previous month, making them useless.

**Option 2 (More detailed, includes both pain points):**

> As a user, I want my monthly reports to display accurate and up-to-date statistics for the current month and to be able to access relevant course recommendations, so that I can effectively monitor my progress and find suitable learning opportunities.  Currently, my monthly reports for April show the same information as March, and the recommended courses feature is not functioning correctly.

**Option 3 (Focus on the impact and desired outcome):**

> As a user, I need my monthly reports to be accurate and my recommended courses to function properly, so that I can make informed decisions about my learning and development and improve my performance.

**Why these are good user stories:**

*   **From the user's perspective:** Each story starts with ""As a user...""
*   **Clear value proposition:** They highlight the *why* (the benefit to the user).
*   **Specific and actionable:**  They outline the problem clearly so developers can understand what needs to be fixed.
*   **Testable:** They provide a basis for defining acceptance criteria (e.g., ""Monthly reports display correct and current data""; ""Recommended courses are relevant and accessible"").

**Key Considerations When Choosing a Version:**

*   The level of detail needed by the development team.
*   Whether to break the issues into separate user stories (one for the report, one for the courses) for better manageability.  This might be preferred if the issues are handled by different teams or require significantly different effort.

In most cases, **Option 2** is a good starting point because it captures both issues in a single story, but you might want to break them out into separate stories for better tracking and management within your project management tool. Remember to add acceptance criteria to each story to further clarify the requirements."

Nice app needs a little more things that people that have handicap problems can do,Samsung Health,feature_request,"Here are a few options for converting the user review ""Nice app needs a little more things that people that have handicap problems can do"" into a user story, depending on the level of detail you want:

**Option 1 (Focus on the overall need):**

*   **As a user with accessibility needs, I want the app to offer more features designed for people with disabilities, so that I can fully enjoy and utilize the app's functionality.**

**Further Elaboration (Optional - depending on context and the team's process):**

You can further clarify the user story by adding acceptance criteria.  For example, accompanying Option 1:

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The app's navigation is compatible with screen readers.
    *   The app provides alternative text descriptions for all images and interactive elements.
    *   The app allows for customization of font sizes and color contrast.

*   **Actionable:** Gives developers a clear direction for implementation.

When choosing which story to use, consider how specific the user wants, and how much detail is available. The goal is to accurately represent user needs."
I don't know why the my band gets disconnects automatically. And kindly try to enable the reply option to the notifications on honor band ES that will be much appreciated 🙂,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the user review into a user story, ranging from more simple to more detailed:

**Option 1 (Simple):**

*   **As a user, I want my band to stay connected to my phone so I don't miss notifications and have to reconnect it.**

**Option 2 (More Specific):**

*   **As an Honor Band ES user, I want to maintain a stable connection with my phone so that I don't experience automatic disconnections and can receive uninterrupted notifications.**
*   **As an Honor Band ES user, I want to be able to reply to notifications directly from my band so I can respond quickly without pulling out my phone.**

**Option 3 (Breaking down into two stories):**

*   **As an Honor Band ES user, I want a reliable Bluetooth connection between my band and my phone so I don't experience unexpected disconnections.**

*   **As an Honor Band ES user, I want to be able to reply to notifications received on my Honor Band ES so I can quickly respond without needing to use my phone.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **""As a...""**: This clearly defines the user whose perspective we're taking. In this case, it's an Honor Band ES user.
*   **""I want...""**: This clearly states the user's desire or goal.
*   **""So that...""**: This provides the *reason* or *benefit* behind the desire.  It explains *why* the user wants this feature.
* Splitting the review into two separate stories allows for independent prioritizing and assignment.  If addressing disconnections is easier or more urgent, it can be tackled separately from the notification reply feature.

The best option depends on the level of detail needed for your development team to understand and implement the features.  Option 3 is likely the most useful for actually planning out the work."

Slow start up and slow operation why do you need Id now to work?,Huawei Health,problem_report,"Here are a few user stories derived from the user review ""Slow start up and slow operation why do you need Id now to work?"":

**Option 1 (Focus on Performance):**

*   **As a user,** I want the application to start up and operate quickly, **so that** I can use it efficiently and without frustration.

**Option 2 (Focus on ID Requirement):**

*   **As a user,** I don't want to be required to provide my ID to use the application, **because** it adds unnecessary complexity and I am concerned about privacy.

**Option 3 (Combined, Most Comprehensive):**

*   **As a user,** I want the application to start up and operate quickly without requiring me to provide my ID, **so that** I can easily access and use the features I need with minimal frustration and without unnecessary security concerns.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   All options attempt to capture the user's core complaints: slowness and the need for an ID.
*   Option 1 isolates the performance issue.
*   Option 2 isolates the ID requirement issue.
*   Option 3 combines both issues into a single story, making it clear that both problems are important to the user.

The best option to use will depend on the context and what the development team prioritizes.  If the performance and ID requirement are separate, unrelated issues, separate stories might be better.  If they are seen as part of a single user experience problem, a combined story is a good choice."

*   **As a user, I want to be able to export my activity data in GPX format so that I can use my data in other applications.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Strava integration):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to sync my activity data with Strava so that I can share my activities with my friends and track my progress on my preferred platform.**

**Option 3 (More comprehensive and reflects the rating sentiment):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to either export my activity data in GPX format or sync it with Strava so that I can use my data in other applications and give this app a higher rating.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Option 1** is the most straightforward and focuses on the core functionality the user is missing (GPX export).  It's good if Strava is just one example use case of why a GPX export is desired.
*   **Option 2** is focused on Strava directly.  If Strava is a key target integration for your app, this might be the better option.
*   **Option 3** acknowledges both options and links it to the user's overall satisfaction (higher rating).  This is a good choice if you want to emphasize the importance of addressing this feature gap to improve user perception of the app.

**Which option is best depends on the context and your product priorities.**  Consider what the user is *really* trying to accomplish and choose the story that best represents that need."

Using vivosmart HR just wish when i manually add my basketball games (not allowed to wear watch) that it could estimate steps and calories burnt with the data I input. Also doesnt sometimes sync fails if I have been using another bluetooth device,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few options for user stories based on the review, focusing on different aspects:

**Option 1 (Focus on Basketball Activity):**

*   **As a basketball player who uses a vivosmart HR,**
*   **I want to be able to manually add my basketball games and have the app estimate steps and calories burned,**
*   **so that I can have a more complete picture of my daily activity and fitness data, even when I can't wear my watch.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Manual Activity Input in General):**

*   **As a vivosmart HR user,**
*   **I want the app to estimate steps and calories burned when I manually add an activity,**
*   **so that I can track activities where I cannot wear my device and still get a comprehensive fitness overview.**

**Option 3 (Focus on Bluetooth Sync Issues):**

*   **As a vivosmart HR user,**
*   **I want my device to consistently sync with the app, regardless of whether I've recently used other Bluetooth devices,**
*   **so that I can ensure my data is always accurate and up-to-date.**

**Option 4 (Combined Story - Addresses both issues):**

*   **As a vivosmart HR user,**
*   **I want the app to estimate steps and calories burned when I manually add activities (like basketball),**
*   **And, I want my device to sync reliably even if I've used other Bluetooth devices recently,**
*   **So that I can accurately track all my activity data and ensure it is always up to date.**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **The ""As a...I want...So that..."" format:** This is the standard user story format.
*   **Specificity:**  Option 1 is very specific to basketball. Option 2 is more general. Option 3 focuses exclusively on the sync issue. Option 4 is the most comprehensive, covering both points.
*   **Clarity:** The stories aim to clearly convey what the user wants and why they want it.
*   **User Perspective:** The wording is from the user's point of view.

Which option is best depends on the priorities of the development team. If basketball is a key use case, Option 1 might be suitable.

**User Story 2 (Focus: Update Issues Impacting Functionality):**

*   **As a user, I want updates to improve the app's functionality, not introduce new problems, so that I can continue using the app without disruptions.**

**User Story 3 (Focus: Unnecessary Login Requirement):**

*   **As a user, I do not want to be forced to log in when using features that previously did not require it, so that I can use the app quickly and conveniently.**  (Alternative:  **As a user, I expect a clear and logical justification for increased security measures like mandatory login, so that I can understand the rationale behind the change.**)

**User Story 4 (Comprehensive, Covering All Issues):**

*   **As a user of the app, I'm finding this recent update frustrating. I expect and require reliable bluetooth connectivity, especially when it previously worked, without any requirement for a new login, so that I can connect seamlessly and immediately start using the app as I always have.**

**Explanation of the User Story Structure:**

All these user stories follow the common ""As a [User Type], I want [Goal], so that [Benefit]"" structure. This framework helps the development team understand:

*   **Who:** Who is the user experiencing the problem? (In this case, just a general user)
*   **What:** What is it that the user wants to achieve? (Stable connection, functional updates, no unnecessary login)
*   **Why:** Why is this important to the user? (Seamless use, no disruptions, quick and convenient use)

The best user story to use will depend on the specific context and how the development team prioritizes the concerns.  For example, if Bluetooth is a core function of the app, User Story 1 might be the highest priority. The comprehensive version might be best for communicating the overall issue."

"Did not want this. Cannot delete it. Cannot even turn out off. Google, block this app!",Samsung Health,problem_report,"Okay, here are a few user stories based on the user review, prioritizing different aspects of the problem.  I'll also include some acceptance criteria to help clarify the issues:

**User Story 1 (Focus on Unwanted Installation):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to avoid installing unwanted apps on my device, so that I am not bothered by things I didn't ask for.**

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The app should not be installed on my device without my explicit permission.
        *   There should be clear and understandable prompts and confirmations before installation.
        *   I should be able to easily opt out of installations if I am not sure about it.

**User Story 2 (Focus on Deletion Problem):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to easily uninstall any app from my device, so that I can free up space and remove unwanted software.**

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The app can be uninstalled through standard device settings or app management interfaces.
        *   The uninstall process should be straightforward and require minimal steps.
        *   All app data and associated files should be completely removed upon uninstallation.

**User Story 3 (Focus on Disabling Problem):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to disable an app on my device if I can't uninstall it, so that it stops running and using resources.** *(This is a compromise if deletion is difficult)*

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The app can be disabled through standard device settings or app management interfaces.
        *   When disabled, the app should not run in the background or consume system resources.
        *   Disabling the app should not cause other apps or system functions to malfunction.

**User Story 4 (The most direct, but somewhat vague):**

*   **As a user, I want to be able to remove this application from my device, so that it no longer bothers or impacts me.**

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   I can completely remove the app and all associated data from my device.
        *   The app does not run or consume resources after removal.
        *   The removal process is clear and easy to understand.

**Choosing the Best Story:**

The best user story depends on the goal. Realistically, all of these are valid issues and could be separate stories. You might choose User Story 2 or 4 if the primary concern is the user's inability to get rid of the app. User Story 1 might be relevant if you want to address how the app is being installed in the first place (potentially unwanted software being bundled, etc.). User Story 3 is a fallback, addressing the issue of resource consumption and unwanted activity if deletion is a complex issue.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **""Google, block this app!""** This part of the review suggests that the application might be harmful or deceptive, potentially violating platform policies. If that's the case, the development team should investigate the application's behavior very thoroughly.
*   The user is clearly frustrated. Whatever solution is implemented should prioritize ease of use and transparency.
*  It might be useful to investigate how the user acquired the app to prevent similar issues for other users."

App can't connect to the watch. Since the last update it is even worse.,Garmin Connect,problem_report,"Here are a few options for converting the user review ""App can't connect to the watch. Since the last update it is even worse"" into a user story, each emphasizing slightly different aspects.

**Option 1 (Focus on Core Functionality):**

*   **As a watch user, I want the app to reliably connect to my watch so that I can use its features and track relevant data.**

**Option 2 (Focus on Regression - the worsened experience):**

*   **As a watch user, I am frustrated that the connection between the app and my watch has become even less reliable since the last update, and I want the connection to be restored to its previous (or better) functionality.**

**Option 3 (Focus on a Specific Goal - Implied):**

*   **As a watch user, I need the app to connect to my watch so I can [implied goal, e.g., track my fitness data, receive notifications, etc.  Choose the most likely goal here]. The current connection issues since the last update are preventing me from doing this.**

*   **""I want/need..."" (Goal/Need):**  States what the user is trying to achieve. This is flexible depending on interpretation.  Option 1 focuses on core functionality. Option 2 highlights the degradation. Option 3 infers a more specific user goal.
*   **""So that..."" (Benefit):**  Explains *why* the user wants or needs this. This is often left implied in very short user stories, but can be added for clarity.

**Which one is best?**

The best option depends on the context:

*   If the team already understands the general purpose of the app and its connection to the watch, **Option 1** is suitable as it is concise.
*   If the team needs to understand the impact of a recent update, **Option 2** is better to highlight the regression.
*   If the team is trying to prioritize specific watch features, **Option 3** helps link the connection issue to a concrete user goal.  You'd need to fill in the most likely goal based on your understanding of the app.

In summary, all the options are valid translations.  Choose the option that best fits the needs of your team and the context of the user feedback."

**Option 2 (Focus on preventing regression):**

*   **As a user of the Health device, I want to be confident that app updates will not break existing functionality, so that I don't lose access to important health data or features.**

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Regression testing is performed on all existing features before releasing an app update.
        *   The update process includes a mechanism to revert to a previous version if a critical issue is detected.
        *   Documentation is provided explaining any changes or potential impacts of the update.

**Option 3 (Focus on general update quality):**
